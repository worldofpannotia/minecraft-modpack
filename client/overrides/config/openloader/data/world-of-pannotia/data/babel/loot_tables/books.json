It was like the sound of a church-bell: but it was only heard for a moment, for the rolling of the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"carriages and the voices of the multitude made too great a noise. Those persons who were walking outside the town, where the houses were farther apart, with gardens or little fields between them, could see the evening sky still better, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"heard the sound of the bell much more distinctly. It was as if the tones came from a church in the still forest; people looked thitherward, and felt their minds attuned most solemnly. A long time passed, and people said to each other--\\\\\\\"I wonder if\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"there is a church out in the wood? The bell has a tone that is wondrous sweet; let us stroll thither, and examine the matter nearer.\\\\\\\" And the rich people drove out, and the poor walked, but the way seemed strangely long to them; and when they came to a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"clump of willows which grew on the skirts of the forest, they sat down, and looked up at the long branches, and fancied they were now in the depth of the green wood. The confectioner of the town came out, and set up his booth there; and soon\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"after came another confectioner, who hung a bell over his stand, as a sign or ornament, but it had no clapper, and it was tarred over to preserve it from the rain. When all the people returned home, they said it had been very romantic, and that it was\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"quite a different sort of thing to a pic-nic or tea-party. There were three persons who asserted they had penetrated to the end of the forest, and that they had always heard the wonderful sounds of the bell, but it had seemed to them as if it had come\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"from the town. One wrote a whole poem about it, and said the bell sounded like the voice of a mother to a good dear child, and that no melody was sweeter than the tones of the bell. The king of the country was also observant of it, and vowed that he who\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"could discover whence the sounds proceeded, should have the title of \\\\\\\"Universal Bell-ringer,\\\\\\\" even if it were not really a bell. Many persons now went to the wood, for the sake of getting the place, but one only returned with a sort of\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"explanation; for nobody went far enough, that one not further than the others. However, he said that the sound proceeded from a very large owl, in a hollow tree; a sort of learned owl, that continually knocked its head against the branches. But\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"whether the sound came from his head or from the hollow tree, that no one could say with certainty. So now he got the place of \\\\\\\"Universal Bell-ringer,\\\\\\\" and wrote yearly a short treatise \\\\\\\"On the Owl\\\\\\\"; but everybody was just as wise as before. It was the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"day of confirmation. The clergyman had spoken so touchingly, the children who were confirmed had been greatly moved; it was an eventful day for them; from children they become all at once grown-up-persons; it was as if their\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"infant souls were now to fly all at once into persons with more understanding. The sun was shining gloriously; the children that had been confirmed went out of the town; and from the wood was borne towards them the sounds of the unknown bell with\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"wonderful distinctness. They all immediately felt a wish to go thither; all except three. One of them had to go home to try on a ball-dress; for it was just the dress and the ball which had caused her to be confirmed this time, for otherwise she\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"would not have come; the other was a poor boy, who had borrowed his coat and boots to be confirmed in from the innkeeper's son, and he was to give them back by a certain hour; the third said that he never went to a strange place if his parents were not\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"with him--that he had always been a good boy hitherto, and would still be so now that he was confirmed, and that one ought not to laugh at him for it: the others, however, did make fun of him, after all. There were three, therefore, that did not go; the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"others hastened on. The sun shone, the birds sang, and the children sang too, and each held the other by the hand; for as yet they had none of them any high office, and were all of equal rank in the eye of God. But two of the youngest soon grew tired,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and both returned to town; two little girls sat down, and twined garlands, so they did not go either; and when the others reached the willow-tree, where the confectioner was, they said, \\\\\\\"Now we are there! In reality the bell does not exist; it is only\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"a fancy that people have taken into their heads!\\\\\\\" At the same moment the bell sounded deep in the wood, so clear and solemnly that five or six determined to penetrate somewhat further. It was so thick, and the foliage so dense, that it was quite\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"fatiguing to proceed. Woodroof and anemonies grew almost too high; blooming convolvuluses and blackberry-bushes hung in long garlands from tree to tree, where the nightingale sang and the sunbeams were playing: it was\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"very beautiful, but it was no place for girls to go; their clothes would get so torn. Large blocks of stone lay there, overgrown with moss of every color; the fresh spring bubbled forth, and made a strange gurgling sound. \\\\\\\"That surely cannot be the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"bell,\\\\\\\" said one of the children, lying down and listening. \\\\\\\"This must be looked to.\\\\\\\" So he remained, and let the others go on without him. They afterwards came to a little house, made of branches and the bark of trees; a large wild apple-tree bent over\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"it, as if it would shower down all its blessings on the roof, where roses were blooming. The long stems twined round the gable, on which there hung a small bell. Was it that which people had heard? Yes, everybody was unanimous on the subject, except\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"one, who said that the bell was too small and too fine to be heard at so great a distance, and besides it was very different tones to those that could move a human heart in such a manner. It was a king's son who spoke; whereon the others said, \\\\\\\"Such\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"people always want to be wiser than everybody else.\\\\\\\" They now let him go on alone; and as he went, his breast was filled more and more with the forest solitude; but he still heard the little bell with which the others were so satisfied, and now and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"then, when the wind blew, he could also hear the people singing who were sitting at tea where the confectioner had his tent; but the deep sound of the bell rose louder; it was almost as if an organ were accompanying it, and the tones came from the left\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"hand, the side where the heart is placed. A rustling was heard in the bushes, and a little boy stood before the King's Son, a boy in wooden shoes, and with so short a jacket that one could see what long wrists he had. Both knew each other: the boy was\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"that one among the children who could not come because he had to go home and return his jacket and boots to the innkeeper's son. This he had done, and was now going on in wooden shoes and in his humble dress, for the bell sounded with so deep a tone,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and with such strange power, that proceed he must. \\\\\\\"Why, then, we can go together,\\\\\\\" said the King's Son. But the poor child that had been confirmed was quite ashamed; he looked at his wooden shoes, pulled at the short sleeves of his jacket, and said\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"that he was afraid he could not walk so fast; besides, he thought that the bell must be looked for to the right; for that was the place where all sorts of beautiful things were to be found. \\\\\\\"But there we shall not meet,\\\\\\\" said the King's Son, nodding at\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the same time to the poor boy, who went into the darkest, thickest part of the wood, where thorns tore his humble dress, and scratched his face and hands and feet till they bled. The King's Son got some scratches too; but the sun shone on\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"his path, and it is him that we will follow, for he was an excellent and resolute youth. \\\\\\\"I must and will find the bell,\\\\\\\" said he, \\\\\\\"even if I am obliged to go to the end of the world.\\\\\\\" The ugly apes sat upon the trees, and grinned. \\\\\\\"Shall we thrash\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"him?\\\\\\\" said they. \\\\\\\"Shall we thrash him? He is the son of a king!\\\\\\\" But on he went, without being disheartened, deeper and deeper into the wood, where the most wonderful flowers were growing. There stood white lilies with blood-red stamina, skyblue tulips,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"which shone as they waved in the winds, and apple-trees, the apples of which looked exactly like large soapbubbles: so only think how the trees must have sparkled in the sunshine! Around the nicest green meads, where the deer were playing in the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"grass, grew magnificent oaks and beeches; and if the bark of one of the trees was cracked, there grass and long creeping plants grew in the crevices. And there were large calm lakes there too, in which white swans were swimming, and beat the air with\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"their wings. The King's Son often stood still and listened. He thought the bell sounded from the depths of these still lakes; but then he remarked again that the tone proceeded not from there, but farther off, from out the depths of the forest. The sun\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"now set: the atmosphere glowed like fire. It was still in the woods, so very still; and he fell on his knees, sung his evening hymn, and said: \\\\\\\"I cannot find what I seek; the sun is going down, and night is coming--the dark, dark night. Yet perhaps I\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"may be able once more to see the round red sun before he entirely disappears. I will climb up yonder rock.\\\\\\\" And he seized hold of the creeping-plants, and the roots of trees--climbed up the moist stones where the water-snakes\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"were writhing and the toads were croaking--and he gained the summit before the sun had quite gone down. How magnificent was the sight from this height! The sea--the great, the glorious sea, that dashed its long waves against the coast--was\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"stretched out before him. And yonder, where sea and sky meet, stood the sun, like a large shining altar, all melted together in the most glowing colors. And the wood and the sea sang a song of rejoicing, and his heart sang with the rest: all nature\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"was a vast holy church, in which the trees and the buoyant clouds were the pillars, flowers and grass the velvet carpeting, and heaven itself the large cupola. The red colors above faded away as the sun vanished, but a million stars were\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"lighted, a million lamps shone; and the King's Son spread out his arms towards heaven, and wood, and sea; when at the same moment, coming by a path to the right, appeared, in his wooden shoes and jacket, the poor boy who had been confirmed with\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"him. He had followed his own path, and had reached the spot just as soon as the son of the king had done. They ran towards each other, and stood together hand in hand in the vast church of nature and of poetry, while over them sounded the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"invisible holy bell: blessed spirits floated around them, and lifted up their voices in a rejoicing hallelujah!\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

And\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"now stood there an old peasant-woman, who came from Soroe, where grass grows in the market-place.

He did not trouble himself in the least about his soldiers; nor did he care to go either to the theatre or the chase, except for\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the opportunities then afforded him for displaying his new clothes. He had a different suit for each hour of the day; and as of any other king or emperor, one is accustomed to say, \\\\\\\"he is sitting in council,\\\\\\\" it was always said of him, \\\\\\\"The\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Emperor is sitting in his wardrobe.\\\\\\\" Time passed merrily in the large town which was his capital; strangers arrived every day at the court. One day, two rogues, calling themselves weavers, made their appearance. They gave out that they knew how to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"weave stuffs of the most beautiful colors and elaborate patterns, the clothes manufactured from which should have the wonderful property of remaining invisible to everyone who was unfit for the office he held, or who was extraordinarily simple in\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"character. \\\\\\\"These must, indeed, be splendid clothes!\\\\\\\" thought the Emperor. \\\\\\\"Had I such a suit, I might at once find out what men in my realms are unfit for their office, and also be able to distinguish the wise from the foolish! This stuff must be woven\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"for me immediately.\\\\\\\" And he caused large sums of money to be given to both the weavers in order that they might begin their work directly. So the two pretended weavers set up two looms, and affected to work very busily, though in reality they did\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"nothing at all. They asked for the most delicate silk and the purest gold thread; put both into their own knapsacks; and then continued their pretended work at the empty looms until late at night. \\\\\\\"I should like to know how the weavers are getting on\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"with my cloth,\\\\\\\" said the Emperor to himself, after some little time had elapsed; he was, however, rather embarrassed, when he remembered that a simpleton, or one unfit for his office, would be unable to see the manufacture. To be sure, he thought\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"he had nothing to risk in his own person; but yet, he would prefer sending somebody else, to bring him intelligence about the weavers, and their work, before he troubled himself in the affair. All the people throughout the city had heard of the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"wonderful property the cloth was to possess; and all were anxious to learn how wise, or how ignorant, their neighbors might prove to be. \\\\\\\"I will send my faithful old minister to the weavers,\\\\\\\" said the Emperor at last, after some\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"deliberation, \\\\\\\"he will be best able to see how the cloth looks; for he is a man of sense, and no one can be more suitable for his office than he is.\\\\\\\" So the faithful old minister went into the hall, where the knaves were working with all their might,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"at their empty looms. \\\\\\\"What can be the meaning of this?\\\\\\\" thought the old man, opening his eyes very wide. \\\\\\\"I cannot discover the least bit of thread on the looms.\\\\\\\" However, he did not express his thoughts aloud. The impostors requested him very\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"courteously to be so good as to come nearer their looms; and then asked him whether the design pleased him, and whether the colors were not very beautiful; at the same time pointing to the empty frames. The poor old minister looked and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"looked, he could not discover anything on the looms, for a very good reason, viz: there was nothing there. \\\\\\\"What!\\\\\\\" thought he again. \\\\\\\"Is it possible that I am a simpleton? I have never thought so myself; and no one must know it now if I am so. Can it\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"be, that I am unfit for my office? No, that must not be said either. I will never confess that I could not see the stuff.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Well, Sir Minister!\\\\\\\" said one of the knaves, still pretending to work. \\\\\\\"You do not say whether the stuff pleases you.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Oh,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"it is excellent!\\\\\\\" replied the old minister, looking at the loom through his spectacles. \\\\\\\"This pattern, and the colors, yes, I will tell the Emperor without delay, how very beautiful I think them.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"We shall be much obliged to you,\\\\\\\" said the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"impostors, and then they named the different colors and described the pattern of the pretended stuff. The old minister listened attentively to their words, in order that he might repeat them to the Emperor; and then the knaves asked for more\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"silk and gold, saying that it was necessary to complete what they had begun. However, they put all that was given them into their knapsacks; and continued to work with as much apparent diligence as before at their empty looms. The Emperor now sent\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"another officer of his court to see how the men were getting on, and to ascertain whether the cloth would soon be ready. It was just the same with this gentleman as with the minister; he surveyed the looms on all sides, but could see nothing at all but\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the empty frames. \\\\\\\"Does not the stuff appear as beautiful to you, as it did to my lord the minister?\\\\\\\" asked the impostors of the Emperor's second ambassador; at the same time making the same gestures as before, and talking of the design and colors\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"which were not there. \\\\\\\"I certainly am not stupid!\\\\\\\" thought the messenger. \\\\\\\"It must be, that I am not fit for my good, profitable office! That is very odd; however, no one shall know anything about it.\\\\\\\" And accordingly he praised the stuff\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"he could not see, and declared that he was delighted with both colors and patterns. \\\\\\\"Indeed, please your Imperial Majesty,\\\\\\\" said he to his sovereign when he returned, \\\\\\\"the cloth which the weavers are preparing is extraordinarily magnificent.\\\\\\\" The\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"whole city was talking of the splendid cloth which the Emperor had ordered to be woven at his own expense. And now the Emperor himself wished to see the costly manufacture, while it was still in the loom. Accompanied by a select number of officers of\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the court, among whom were the two honest men who had already admired the cloth, he went to the crafty impostors, who, as soon as they were aware of the Emperor's approach, went on working more diligently than ever; although they\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"still did not pass a single thread through the looms. \\\\\\\"Is not the work absolutely magnificent?\\\\\\\" said the two officers of the crown, already mentioned. \\\\\\\"If your Majesty will only be pleased to look at it! What a splendid design! What\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"glorious colors!\\\\\\\" and at the same time they pointed to the empty frames; for they imagined that everyone else could see this exquisite piece of workmanship. \\\\\\\"How is this?\\\\\\\" said the Emperor to himself. \\\\\\\"I can see nothing! This is indeed a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"terrible affair! Am I a simpleton, or am I unfit to be an Emperor? That would be the worst thing that could happen--Oh! the cloth is charming,\\\\\\\" said he, aloud. \\\\\\\"It has my complete approbation.\\\\\\\" And he smiled most graciously, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"looked closely at the empty looms; for on no account would he say that he could not see what two of the officers of his court had praised so much. All his retinue now strained their eyes, hoping to discover something on the looms, but they could see no\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"more than the others; nevertheless, they all exclaimed, \\\\\\\"Oh, how beautiful!\\\\\\\" and advised his majesty to have some new clothes made from this splendid material, for the approaching procession. \\\\\\\"Magnificent!\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Charming! Excellent!\\\\\\\" resounded on all sides; and everyone was uncommonly gay. The Emperor shared in the general satisfaction; and presented the impostors with the riband of an order of knighthood, to be worn in their button-holes, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the title of \\\\\\\"Gentlemen Weavers.\\\\\\\" The rogues sat up the whole of the night before the day on which the procession was to take place, and had sixteen lights burning, so that everyone might see how anxious they were to finish the Emperor's new\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"suit. They pretended to roll the cloth off the looms; cut the air with their scissors; and sewed with needles without any thread in them. \\\\\\\"See!\\\\\\\" cried they, at last. \\\\\\\"The Emperor's new clothes are ready!\\\\\\\" And now the Emperor, with all the grandees of\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"his court, came to the weavers; and the rogues raised their arms, as if in the act of holding something up, saying, \\\\\\\"Here are your Majesty's trousers! Here is the scarf! Here is the mantle! The whole suit is as light as a cobweb; one might fancy one has\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"nothing at all on, when dressed in it; that, however, is the great virtue of this delicate cloth.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Yes indeed!\\\\\\\" said all the courtiers, although not one of them could see anything of this exquisite manufacture. \\\\\\\"If your Imperial Majesty will be\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"graciously pleased to take off your clothes, we will fit on the new suit, in front of the looking glass.\\\\\\\" The Emperor was accordingly undressed, and the rogues pretended to array him in his new suit; the Emperor turning round, from side to side,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"before the looking glass. \\\\\\\"How splendid his Majesty looks in his new clothes, and how well they fit!\\\\\\\" everyone cried out. \\\\\\\"What a design! What colors! These are indeed royal robes!\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"The canopy which is to be borne over your Majesty, in the procession,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"is waiting,\\\\\\\" announced the chief master of the ceremonies. \\\\\\\"I am quite ready,\\\\\\\" answered the Emperor. \\\\\\\"Do my new clothes fit well?\\\\\\\" asked he, turning himself round again before the looking glass, in order that he might appear to be examining his\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"handsome suit. The lords of the bedchamber, who were to carry his Majesty's train felt about on the ground, as if they were lifting up the ends of the mantle; and pretended to be carrying something; for they would by no means betray\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"anything like simplicity, or unfitness for their office. So now the Emperor walked under his high canopy in the midst of the procession, through the streets of his capital; and all the people standing by, and those at the windows, cried\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"out, \\\\\\\"Oh! How beautiful are our Emperor's new clothes! What a magnificent train there is to the mantle; and how gracefully the scarf hangs!\\\\\\\" in short, no one would allow that he could not see these much-admired clothes; because,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"in doing so, he would have declared himself either a simpleton or unfit for his office. Certainly, none of the Emperor's various suits, had ever made so great an impression, as these invisible ones. \\\\\\\"But the Emperor has nothing at all on!\\\\\\\"\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"said a little child. \\\\\\\"Listen to the voice of innocence!\\\\\\\" exclaimed his father; and what the child had said was whispered from one to another. \\\\\\\"But he has nothing at all on!\\\\\\\" at last cried out all the people. The Emperor was vexed, for he knew that the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"people were right; but he thought the procession must go on now! And the lords of the bedchamber took greater pains than ever, to appear holding up a train, although, in reality, there was no train to hold.\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

When the Cat had what he asked for he booted himself very gallantly, and putting his bag about his neck, he held the strings of it in his two forepaws and went into a warren where was great abundance of rabbits. He put\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"bran and sow-thistle into his bag, and stretching out at length, as if he had been dead, he waited for some young rabbits, not yet acquainted with the deceits of the world, to come and rummage his bag for what he had put into it. Scarce was he lain down\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"but he had what he wanted. A rash and foolish young rabbit jumped into his bag, and Monsieur Puss, immediately drawing close the strings, took and killed him without pity.

He was shown upstairs into the King's apartment, and, making a low reverence, said to him: \\\\\\\"I have brought you, sir, a rabbit of the warren, which my noble lord the Marquis of Carabas\\\\\\\" (for that was the title which puss was pleased to give his\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"master) \\\\\\\"has commanded me to present to your majesty from him.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Tell thy master,\\\\\\\" said the king, \\\\\\\"that I thank him and that he does me a great deal of pleasure.\\\\\\\" Another time he went and hid himself among some standing corn, holding still his\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"bag open, and when a brace of partridges ran into it he drew the strings and so caught them both. He went and made a present of these to the king, as he had done before of the rabbit which he took in the warren. The king, in like manner, received the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"partridges with great pleasure, and ordered him some money for drink. The Cat continued for two or three months thus to carry his Majesty, from time to time, game of his master's taking. One day in particular, when he knew for certain that he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"was to take the air along the river-side, with his daughter, the most beautiful princess in the world, he said to his master: \\\\\\\"If you will follow my advice your fortune is made. You have nothing else to do but go and wash yourself in the river, in that\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"part I shall show you, and leave the rest to me.\\\\\\\" The Marquis of Carabas did what the Cat advised him to, without knowing why or wherefore. While he was washing the King passed by, and the Cat began to cry out: \\\\\\\"Help! help! My Lord Marquis of Carabas is\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"going to be drowned.\\\\\\\" At this noise the King put his head out of the coach-window, and, finding it was the Cat who had so often brought him such good game, he commanded his guards to run immediately to the assistance of his Lordship the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Marquis of Carabas. While they were drawing the poor Marquis out of the river, the Cat came up to the coach and told the King that, while his master was washing, there came by some rogues, who went off with his clothes, though he had cried out:\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"Thieves! thieves!\\\\\\\" several times, as loud as he could. This cunning Cat had hidden them under a great stone. The King immediately commanded the officers of his wardrobe to run and fetch one of his best suits for the Lord Marquis of\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Carabas. The King caressed him after a very extraordinary manner, and as the fine clothes he had given him extremely set off his good mien (for he was well made and very handsome in his person), the King's daughter took a secret inclination to him, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the Marquis of Carabas had no sooner cast two or three respectful and somewhat tender glances but she fell in love with him to distraction. The King would needs have him come into the coach and take part of the airing. The Cat, quite overjoyed to see\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"his project begin to succeed, marched on before, and, meeting with some countrymen, who were mowing a meadow, he said to them: \\\\\\\"Good people, you who are mowing, if you do not tell the King that the meadow you mow belongs to my Lord Marquis of\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Carabas, you shall be chopped as small as herbs for the pot.\\\\\\\" The King did not fail asking of the mowers to whom the meadow they were mowing belonged. \\\\\\\"To my Lord Marquis of Carabas,\\\\\\\" answered they altogether, for the Cat's threats had made them\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"terribly afraid. \\\\\\\"You see, sir,\\\\\\\" said the Marquis, \\\\\\\"this is a meadow which never fails to yield a plentiful harvest every year.\\\\\\\" The Master Cat, who went still on before, met with some reapers, and said to them: \\\\\\\"Good people, you who are reaping, if you\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"do not tell the King that all this corn belongs to the Marquis of Carabas, you shall be chopped as small as herbs for the pot.\\\\\\\" The King, who passed by a moment after, would needs know to whom all that corn, which he then saw, did belong. \\\\\\\"To my Lord\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Marquis of Carabas,\\\\\\\" replied the reapers, and the King was very well pleased with it, as well as the Marquis, whom he congratulated thereupon. The Master Cat, who went always before, said the same words to all he met, and the King was astonished at\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the vast estates of my Lord Marquis of Carabas. Monsieur Puss came at last to a stately castle, the master of which was an ogre, the richest had ever been known; for all the lands which the King had then gone over belonged to this castle. The Cat,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"who had taken care to inform himself who this ogre was and what he could do, asked to speak with him, saying he could not pass so near his castle without having the honor of paying his respects to him. The ogre received him as civilly as an ogre could\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"do, and made him sit down. \\\\\\\"I have been assured,\\\\\\\" said the Cat, \\\\\\\"that you have the gift of being able to change yourself into all sorts of creatures you have a mind to; you can, for example, transform yourself into a lion, or elephant, and the like.\\\\\\\"\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"That is true,\\\\\\\" answered the ogre very briskly; \\\\\\\"and to convince you, you shall see me now become a lion.\\\\\\\" Puss was so sadly terrified at the sight of a lion so near him that he immediately got into the gutter, not without abundance of\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"trouble and danger, because of his boots, which were of no use at all to him in walking upon the tiles. A little while after, when Puss saw that the ogre had resumed his natural form, he came down, and owned he had been very much frightened. \\\\\\\"I\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"have been, moreover, informed,\\\\\\\" said the Cat, \\\\\\\"but I know not how to believe it, that you have also the power to take on you the shape of the smallest animals; for example, to change yourself into a rat or a mouse; but I must own to you I take this to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"be impossible.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Impossible!\\\\\\\" cried the ogre; \\\\\\\"you shall see that presently.\\\\\\\" And at the same time he changed himself into a mouse, and began to run about the floor. Puss no sooner perceived this but he fell upon him and ate him up. Meanwhile the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"King, who saw, as he passed, this fine castle of the ogre's, had a mind to go into it. Puss, who heard the noise of his Majesty's coach running over the draw-bridge, ran out, and said to the King: \\\\\\\"Your Majesty is welcome to this castle of my Lord\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Marquis of Carabas.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"What! my Lord Marquis,\\\\\\\" cried the King, \\\\\\\"and does this castle also belong to you? There can be nothing finer than this court and all the stately buildings which surround it; let us go into it, if you please.\\\\\\\" The Marquis gave his\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"hand to the Princess, and followed the King, who went first. They passed into a spacious hall, where they found a magnificent collation, which the ogre had prepared for his friends, who were that very day to visit him, but dared not to enter, knowing\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the King was there. His Majesty was perfectly charmed with the good qualities of my Lord Marquis of Carabas, as was his daughter, who had fallen violently in love with him, and, seeing the vast estate he possessed, said to him, after having\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"drunk five or six glasses: \\\\\\\"It will be owing to yourself only, my Lord Marquis, if you are not my son-in-law.\\\\\\\" The Marquis, making several low bows, accepted the honor which his Majesty conferred upon him, and forthwith, that very same day,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"married the Princess.

In the middle of the village lived old Dame Shoemaker; she sat and sewed together, as well as she could, a little pair of shoes out of old red strips of cloth; they were very clumsy, but it was a kind thought.

On the very day her mother was buried, Karen received the red shoes, and wore them for the first time. They were certainly not intended for mourning, but she had no others, and with stockingless feet she followed\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the poor straw coffin in them. Suddenly a large old carriage drove up, and a large old lady sat in it: she looked at the little girl, felt compassion for her, and then said to the clergyman: \\\\\\\"Here, give me the little girl. I will adopt her!\\\\\\\" And Karen\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"believed all this happened on account of the red shoes, but the old lady thought they were horrible, and they were burnt. But Karen herself was cleanly and nicely dressed; she must learn to read and sew; and people said she was a nice\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"little thing, but the looking-glass said: \\\\\\\"Thou art more than nice, thou art beautiful!\\\\\\\" Now the queen once travelled through the land, and she had her little daughter with her. And this little daughter was a princess, and people streamed to the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"castle, and Karen was there also, and the little princess stood in her fine white dress, in a window, and let herself be stared at; she had neither a train nor a golden crown, but splendid red morocco shoes. They were certainly far handsomer than\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"those Dame Shoemaker had made for little Karen. Nothing in the world can be compared with red shoes. Now Karen was old enough to be confirmed; she had new clothes and was to have new shoes also. The rich shoemaker in the city took the measure\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"of her little foot. This took place at his house, in his room; where stood large glass-cases, filled with elegant shoes and brilliant boots. All this looked charming, but the old lady could not see well, and so had no pleasure in them. In the midst of\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the shoes stood a pair of red ones, just like those the princess had worn. How beautiful they were! The shoemaker said also they had been made for the child of a count, but had not fitted. \\\\\\\"That must be patent leather!\\\\\\\" said the old lady. \\\\\\\"They shine\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"so!\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Yes, they shine!\\\\\\\" said Karen, and they fitted, and were bought, but the old lady knew nothing about their being red, else she would never have allowed Karen to have gone in red shoes to be confirmed. Yet such was the case. Everybody looked\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"at her feet; and when she stepped through the chancel door on the church pavement, it seemed to her as if the old figures on the tombs, those portraits of old preachers and preachers' wives, with stiff ruffs, and long black dresses, fixed their eyes\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"on her red shoes. And she thought only of them as the clergyman laid his hand upon her head, and spoke of the holy baptism, of the covenant with God, and how she should be now a matured Christian; and the organ pealed so solemnly; the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"sweet children's voices sang, and the old music-directors sang, but Karen only thought of her red shoes. In the afternoon, the old lady heard from everyone that the shoes had been red, and she said that it was very wrong of Karen, that it was\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"not at all becoming, and that in future Karen should only go in black shoes to church, even when she should be older. The next Sunday there was the sacrament, and Karen looked at the black shoes, looked at the red ones--looked at\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"them again, and put on the red shoes. The sun shone gloriously; Karen and the old lady walked along the path through the corn; it was rather dusty there. At the church door stood an old soldier with a crutch, and with a wonderfully long\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"beard, which was more red than white, and he bowed to the ground, and asked the old lady whether he might dust her shoes. And Karen stretched out her little foot. \\\\\\\"See, what beautiful dancing shoes!\\\\\\\" said the soldier. \\\\\\\"Sit firm when you dance\\\\\\\"; and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"he put his hand out towards the soles. And the old lady gave the old soldier alms, and went into the church with Karen. And all the people in the church looked at Karen's red shoes, and all the pictures, and as Karen knelt before the altar, and raised\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the cup to her lips, she only thought of the red shoes, and they seemed to swim in it; and she forgot to sing her psalm, and she forgot to pray, \\\\\\\"Our Father in Heaven!\\\\\\\" Now all the people went out of church, and the old lady got into her carriage. Karen\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"raised her foot to get in after her, when the old soldier said, \\\\\\\"Look, what beautiful dancing shoes!\\\\\\\" And Karen could not help dancing a step or two, and when she began her feet continued to dance; it was just as though the shoes had power over them.\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"She danced round the church corner, she could not leave off; the coachman was obliged to run after and catch hold of her, and he lifted her in the carriage, but her feet continued to dance so that she trod on the old lady dreadfully. At length she took\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the shoes off, and then her legs had peace. The shoes were placed in a closet at home, but Karen could not avoid looking at them. Now the old lady was sick, and it was said she could not recover. She must be nursed and waited upon, and there was no one\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"whose duty it was so much as Karen's. But there was a great ball in the city, to which Karen was invited. She looked at the old lady, who could not recover, she looked at the red shoes, and she thought there could be no sin in it; she put on the red\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"shoes, she might do that also, she thought. But then she went to the ball and began to dance. When she wanted to dance to the right, the shoes would dance to the left, and when she wanted to dance up the room, the shoes danced back again, down the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"steps, into the street, and out of the city gate. She danced, and was forced to dance straight out into the gloomy wood. Then it was suddenly light up among the trees, and she fancied it must be the moon, for there was a face; but it was the old soldier\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"with the red beard; he sat there, nodded his head, and said, \\\\\\\"Look, what beautiful dancing shoes!\\\\\\\" Then she was terrified, and wanted to fling off the red shoes, but they clung fast; and she pulled down her stockings, but the shoes seemed to have grown\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"to her feet. And she danced, and must dance, over fields and meadows, in rain and sunshine, by night and day; but at night it was the most fearful. She danced over the churchyard, but the dead did not dance--they had something better\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"to do than to dance. She wished to seat herself on a poor man's grave, where the bitter tansy grew; but for her there was neither peace nor rest; and when she danced towards the open church door, she saw an angel standing there. He wore\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"long, white garments; he had wings which reached from his shoulders to the earth; his countenance was severe and grave; and in his hand he held a sword, broad and glittering. \\\\\\\"Dance shalt thou!\\\\\\\" said he. \\\\\\\"Dance in thy red shoes till thou art\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"pale and cold! Till thy skin shrivels up and thou art a skeleton! Dance shalt thou from door to door, and where proud, vain children dwell, thou shalt knock, that they may hear thee and tremble! Dance shalt thou--!\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Mercy!\\\\\\\" cried Karen. But she did\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"not hear the angel's reply, for the shoes carried her through the gate into the fields, across roads and bridges, and she must keep ever dancing. One morning she danced past a door which she well knew. Within sounded a psalm; a coffin, decked with\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"flowers, was borne forth. Then she knew that the old lady was dead, and felt that she was abandoned by all, and condemned by the angel of God. She danced, and she was forced to dance through the gloomy night. The shoes carried her over stack and stone;\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"she was torn till she bled; she danced over the heath till she came to a little house. Here, she knew, dwelt the executioner; and she tapped with her fingers at the window, and said, \\\\\\\"Come out! Come out! I cannot come in, for I am forced to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"dance!\\\\\\\" And the executioner said, \\\\\\\"Thou dost not know who I am, I fancy? I strike bad people's heads off; and I hear that my axe rings!\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Don't strike my head off!\\\\\\\" said Karen. \\\\\\\"Then I can't repent of my sins! But strike off my feet in the red shoes!\\\\\\\"\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"And then she confessed her entire sin, and the executioner struck off her feet with the red shoes, but the shoes danced away with the little feet across the field into the deep wood. And he carved out little wooden feet for her, and crutches,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"taught her the psalm criminals always sing; and she kissed the hand which had wielded the axe, and went over the heath. \\\\\\\"Now I have suffered enough for the red shoes!\\\\\\\" said she. \\\\\\\"Now I will go into the church that people may see me!\\\\\\\" And she hastened\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"towards the church door: but when she was near it, the red shoes danced before her, and she was terrified, and turned round. The whole week she was unhappy, and wept many bitter tears; but when Sunday returned, she said, \\\\\\\"Well, now I have\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"suffered and struggled enough! I really believe I am as good as many a one who sits in the church, and holds her head so high!\\\\\\\" And away she went boldly; but she had not got farther than the churchyard gate before she saw the red shoes\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"dancing before her; and she was frightened, and turned back, and repented of her sin from her heart. And she went to the parsonage, and begged that they would take her into service; she would be very industrious, she said, and would do\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"everything she could; she did not care about the wages, only she wished to have a home, and be with good people. And the clergyman's wife was sorry for her and took her into service; and she was industrious and thoughtful. She\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"sat still and listened when the clergyman read the Bible in the evenings. All the children thought a great deal of her; but when they spoke of dress, and grandeur, and beauty, she shook her head. The following Sunday, when the family\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"was going to church, they asked her whether she would not go with them; but she glanced sorrowfully, with tears in her eyes, at her crutches. The family went to hear the word of God; but she went alone into her little chamber; there was only\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"room for a bed and chair to stand in it; and here she sat down with her Prayer-Book; and whilst she read with a pious mind, the wind bore the strains of the organ towards her, and she raised her tearful countenance, and said, \\\\\\\"O God, help\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"me!\\\\\\\" And the sun shone so clearly, and straight before her stood the angel of God in white garments, the same she had seen that night at the church door; but he no longer carried the sharp sword, but in its stead a splendid green spray, full\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"of roses. And he touched the ceiling with the spray, and the ceiling rose so high, and where he had touched it there gleamed a golden star. And he touched the walls, and they widened out, and she saw the organ which was playing; she saw the old\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"pictures of the preachers and the preachers' wives. The congregation sat in cushioned seats, and sang out of their Prayer-Books. For the church itself had come to the poor girl in her narrow chamber, or else she had come into the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"church. She sat in the pew with the clergyman's family, and when they had ended the psalm and looked up, they nodded and said, \\\\\\\"It is right that thou art come!\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"It was through mercy!\\\\\\\" she said. And the organ pealed, and the children's voices\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"in the choir sounded so sweet and soft! The clear sunshine streamed so warmly through the window into the pew where Karen sat! Her heart was so full of sunshine, peace, and joy, that it broke.

But the distressed mother bent down over all the smallest plants, and heard within them how the human heart beat; and amongst millions she\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"knew her child's. \\\\\\\"There it is!\\\\\\\" cried she, and stretched her hands out over a little blue crocus, that hung quite sickly on one side. \\\\\\\"Don't touch the flower!\\\\\\\" said the old woman. \\\\\\\"But place yourself here, and when Death comes--I expect him every\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"moment--do not let him pluck the flower up, but threaten him that you will do the same with the others.

And Death stretched out his long\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"hand towards the fine little flower, but she held her hands fast around his, so tight, and yet afraid that she should touch one of the leaves.

Ah! he ran and ran till he came bang against the door, and burst it open, and there he was in a joiner's shop. \\\\\\\"You're a likely lad,\\\\\\\" said the joiner;\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"serve me for a twelvemonths and a day and I will pay you well.'\\\\\\\" So he agreed, and served the carpenter for a year and a day. \\\\\\\"Now,\\\\\\\" said the master, \\\\\\\"I will give you your wage;\\\\\\\" and he presented him with a table, telling him he had but to say, \\\\\\\"Table,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"be covered,\\\\\\\" and at once it would be spread with lots to eat and drink. Jack hitched the table on his back, and away he went with it till he came to the inn. \\\\\\\"Well, host,\\\\\\\" shouted he, \\\\\\\"my dinner to-day, and that of the best.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Very sorry, but there is\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"nothing in the house but ham and eggs.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Ham and eggs for me!\\\\\\\" exclaimed Jack. \\\\\\\"I can do better than that.-- Come, my table, be covered!\\\\\\\" At once the table was spread with turkey and sausages, roast mutton, potatoes, and greens. The publican opened his\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"eyes, but he said nothing, not he. That night he fetched down from his attic a table very like that of Jack, and exchanged the two. Jack, none the wiser, next morning hitched the worthless table on to his back and carried it home. \\\\\\\"Now, father, may I\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"marry my lass?\\\\\\\" he asked. \\\\\\\"Not unless you can keep her,\\\\\\\" replied the father. \\\\\\\"Look here!\\\\\\\" exclaimed Jack. \\\\\\\"Father, I have a table which does all my bidding.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Let me see it,\\\\\\\" said the old man. The lad set it in the middle of the room, and bade it\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"be covered; but all in vain, the table remained bare. In a rage, the father caught the warming-pan down from the wall and warmed his son's back with it so that the boy fled howling from the house, and ran and ran till he came to a river and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"tumbled in. A man picked him out and bade him assist him in making a bridge over the river; and how do you think he was doing it? Why, by casting a tree across; so Jack climbed up to the top of the tree and threw his weight on it, so that when the man\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"had rooted the tree up, Jack and the tree-head dropped on the farther bank. \\\\\\\"Thank you,\\\\\\\" said the man; \\\\\\\"and now for what you have done I will pay you;\\\\\\\" so saying, he tore a branch from the tree, and fettled it up into a club with his knife. \\\\\\\"There,\\\\\\\"\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"exclaimed he; \\\\\\\"take this stick, and when you say to it, 'Up stick and bang him,' it will knock any one down who angers you.\\\\\\\" The lad was overjoyed to get this stick--so away he went with it to the inn, and as soon as the publican, appeared, \\\\\\\"Up stick\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and bang him!\\\\\\\" was his cry. At the word the cudgel flew from his hand and battered the old publican on the back, rapped his head, bruised his arms tickled his ribs, till he fell groaning on the floor; still the stick belaboured the prostrate man, nor\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"would Jack call it off till he had got back the stolen ass and table. Then he galloped home on the ass, with the table on his shoulders, and the stick in his hand. When he arrived there he found his father was dead, so he brought his ass into the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"stable, and pulled its ears till he had filled the manger with money. It was soon known through the town that Jack had returned rolling in wealth, and accordingly all the girls in the place set their caps at him. \\\\\\\"Now,\\\\\\\" said Jack, \\\\\\\"I shall marry the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"richest lass in the place; so tomorrow do you all come in front of my house with your money in your aprons.\\\\\\\" Next morning the street was full of girls with aprons held out, and gold and silver in them; but Jack's own sweetheart was among them, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"she had neither gold nor silver, nought but two copper pennies, that was all she had. \\\\\\\"Stand aside, lass;\\\\\\\" said Jack to her, speaking roughly. \\\\\\\"Thou hast no silver nor gold--stand off from the rest.\\\\\\\" She obeyed, and the tears ran down\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"her cheeks, and filled her apron with diamonds. \\\\\\\"Up stick and bang them!\\\\\\\" exclaimed Jack; whereupon the cudgel leaped up, and running along the line of girls, knocked them all on the heads and left them senseless on the pavement. Jack took all their\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"money and poured it into his truelove's lap. \\\\\\\"Now, lass,\\\\\\\" he exclaimed, \\\\\\\"thou art the richest, and I shall marry thee.\\\\\\\"\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

So she hated her sister for taking away Sir William's love, and day by day her hate grew upon her, and she plotted and she planned how to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"get rid of her. So one fine morning, fair and clear, she said to her sister, \\\\\\\"Let us go and see our father's boats come in at the bonny mill-stream of Binnorie.\\\\\\\" So they went there hand in hand. And when they got to the river's bank the youngest got\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"upon a stone to watch for the coming of the boats. And her sister, coming behind her, caught her round the waist and dashed her into the rushing mill-stream of Binnorie. \\\\\\\"O sister, sister, reach me your hand!\\\\\\\" she cried, as she floated away, \\\\\\\"and you\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"shall have half of all I've got or shall get.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"No, sister, I'll reach you no hand of mine, for I am the heir to all your land.

But she was drowned, drowned! And as she lay there in her beauty a famous harper passed by the mill- dam of Binnorie, and saw\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"her sweet pale face. And though he travelled on far away he never forgot that face, and after many days he came back to the bonny mill-stream of Binnorie. But then all he could find of her where they had put her to rest were her bones and her golden\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"hair. So he made a harp out of her breast-bone and her hair, and travelled on up the hill from the mill-dam of Binnorie, till he came to the castle of the king her father.

But he begged, and he begged, till at last the good queen let him go, and gave him his father's good brand that never struck in vain. And as she girt it round his waist, she said the spell that would give it victory. So Childe Rowland said\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"good-bye to the good queen, his mother, and went to the cave of the Warlock Merlin. \\\\\\\"Once more, and but once more,\\\\\\\" he said to the Warlock, \\\\\\\"tell how man or mother's son may rescue Burd Ellen and her brothers twain.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Well, my son,\\\\\\\" said the Warlock\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Merlin, \\\\\\\"there are but two things, simple they may seem, but hard they are to do.

And what you've not to do is this: bite no bit, and drink no drop, however hungry or thirsty you be; drink a drop, or bite a bit, while in Elfland you be and never will you see Middle Earth\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"again.\\\\\\\" So Childe Rowland said the two things over and over again, till he knew them by heart, and he thanked the Warlock Merlin and went on his way.

These he knew by their fiery eyes, and knew that he was at last in the land of Fairy. \\\\\\\"Canst thou tell me,\\\\\\\" said Childe Rowland to the horse-herd, \\\\\\\"where the King of Elfland's Dark Tower is?\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"I cannot tell\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"thee,\\\\\\\" said the horse-herd, \\\\\\\"but go on a little further and thou wilt come to the cow-herd, and he, maybe, can tell thee.\\\\\\\" Then, without a word more, Childe Rowland drew the good brand that never struck in vain, and off went the horse-herd's head, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Childe Rowland went on further, till he came to the cow-herd, and asked him the same question. \\\\\\\"I can't tell thee,\\\\\\\" said he, \\\\\\\"but go on a little farther, and thou wilt come to the hen-wife, and she is sure to know.\\\\\\\" Then Childe Rowland out with his good\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"brand, that never struck in vain, and off went the cow-herd's head.

And let me come in. And the third time the door did open, and he went in, and it closed with a click, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Childe Rowland was left in the dark. It was not exactly dark, but a kind of twilight or gloaming. There were neither windows nor candles, and he could not make out where the twilight came from, if not through the walls and roof. These were rough arches\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"made of a transparent rock, incrusted with sheepsilver and rock spar, and other bright stones. But though it was rock, the air was quite warm, as it always is in Elfland. So he went through this passage till at last he came to two wide and high\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"folding-doors which stood ajar. And when he opened them, there he saw a most wonderful and glorious sight. A large and spacious hall, so large that it seemed to be as long, and as broad, as the green hill itself. The roof was supported by fine pillars,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"so large and lofty, that the pillars of a cathedral were as nothing to them. They were all of gold and silver, with fretted work, and between them and around them, wreaths of flowers, composed of what do you think? Why, of diamonds and emeralds, and all\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"manner of precious stones. And the very key- stones of the arches had for ornaments clusters of diamonds and rubies, and pearls, and other precious stones. And all these arches met in the middle of the roof, and just there, hung by a gold chain, an\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"immense lamp made out of one big pearl hollowed out and quite transparent. And in the middle of this was a big, huge carbuncle, which kept spinning round and round, and this was what gave light by its rays to the whole hall, which seemed as if the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"setting sun was shining on it. The hall was furnished in a manner equally grand, and at one end of it was a glorious couch of velvet, silk and gold, and there sate Burd Ellen, combing her golden hair with a silver comb. And when she saw Childe\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Rowland she stood up and said: \\\\\\\"God pity ye, poor luckless fool, What have ye here to do? \\\\\\\"Hear ye this, my youngest brother, Why didn't ye bide at home? Had you a hundred thousand lives Ye couldn't spare any a one. \\\\\\\"But sit ye down; but woe, O, woe,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"That ever ye were born, For come the King of Elfland in, Your fortune is forlorn.\\\\\\\" Then they sate down together, and Childe Rowland told her all that he had done, and she told him how their two brothers had reached the Dark Tower, but had\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"been enchanted by the King of Elfland, and lay there entombed as if dead. And then after they had talked a little longer Childe Rowland began to feel hungry from his long travels, and told his sister Burd Ellen how hungry he was and asked for some\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"food, forgetting all about the Warlock Merlin's warning. Burd Ellen looked at Childe Rowland sadly, and shook her head, but she was under a spell, and could not warn him. So she rose up, and went out, and soon brought back a golden basin full of bread\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and milk. Childe Rowland was just going to raise it to his lips, when he looked at his sister and remembered why he had come all that way. So he dashed the bowl to the ground, and said: \\\\\\\"Not a sup will I swallow, nor a bit will I bite, till Burd Ellen\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"is set free.\\\\\\\" Just at that moment they heard the noise of some one approaching, and a loud voice was heard saying: \\\\\\\"Fee, fi, fo, fum, I smell the blood of a Christian man, Be he dead, be he living, with my brand, I'll dash his brains from his\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"brain-pan.\\\\\\\" And then the folding-doors of the hall were burst open, and the King of Elfland rushed in. \\\\\\\"Strike then, Bogle, if thou darest,\\\\\\\" shouted out Childe Rowland, and rushed to meet him with his good brand that never yet did fail. They fought, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"they fought, and they fought, till Childe Rowland beat the King of Elfland down on to his knees, and caused him to yield and beg for mercy. \\\\\\\"I grant thee mercy,\\\\\\\" said Childe Rowland, \\\\\\\"release my sister from thy spells and raise my brothers to life, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"let us all go free, and thou shalt be spared.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"I agree,\\\\\\\" said the Elfin King, and rising up he went to a chest from which he took a phial filled with a blood-red liquor. With this he anointed the ears, eyelids, nostrils, lips, and finger-tips, of the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"two brothers, and they sprang at once into life, and declared that their souls had been away, but had now returned. The Elfin king then said some words to Burd Ellen, and she was disenchanted, and they all four passed out of the hall, through the long\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"passage, and turned their back on the Dark Tower, never to return again. And they reached home, and the good queen, their mother, and Burd Ellen never went round a church widershins again.\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

One night she was woke up at midnight, and when she went downstairs, she saw a strange squinny-eyed, little ugly old fellow, who asked her to come to his wife who was too ill to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"mind her baby. Dame Goody didn't like the look of the old fellow, but business is business; so she popped on her things, and went down to him. And when she got down to him, he whisked her up on to a large coal-black horse with fiery eyes, that stood\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"at the door; and soon they were going at a rare pace, Dame Goody holding on to the old fellow like grim death. They rode, and they rode, till at last they stopped before a cottage door. So they got down and went in and found the good woman abed with\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the children playing about; and the babe, a fine bouncing boy, beside her. Dame Goody took the babe, which was as fine a baby boy as you'd wish to see. The mother, when she handed the baby to Dame Goody to mind, gave her a box of ointment, and told\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"her to stroke the baby's eyes with it as soon as it opened them. After a while it began to open its eyes. Dame Goody saw that it had squinny eyes just like its father. So she took the box of ointment and stroked its two eyelids with it. But she\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"couldn't help wondering what it was for, as she had never seen such a thing done before. So she looked to see if the others were looking, and, when they were not noticing she stroked her own right eyelid with the ointment.

The mother in the bed was a beautiful lady, dressed up in white silk.

Its little brothers and sisters around the bed were flat-nosed imps with pointed ears, who made faces at one another, and scratched their polls. Sometimes they would pull the sick lady's ears with their long and hairy\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"paws. In fact, they were up to all kinds of mischief; and Dame Goody knew that she had got into a house of pixies. But she said nothing to nobody, and as soon as the lady was well enough to mind the baby, she asked the old fellow to take her back home.\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"So he came round to the door with the coal-black horse with eyes of fire, and off they went as fast as before, or perhaps a little faster, till they came to Dame Goody's cottage, where the squinny-eyed old fellow lifted her down and left her, thanking\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"her civilly enough, and paying her more than she had ever been paid before for such service. Now next day happened to be market-day, and as Dame Goody had been away from home, she wanted many things in the house, and trudged off to get them at\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the market. As she was buying the things she wanted, who should she see but the squinny-eyed old fellow who had taken her on the coal-black horse. And what do you think he was doing? Why he went about from stall to stall taking up things from each,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"here some fruit, and there some eggs, and so on; and no one seemed to take any notice. Now Dame Goody did not think it her business to interfere, but she thought she ought not to let so good a customer pass without speaking.

So he called for\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"his horse, and rode into York; and passed by the father's house, and saw him sitting by the door, sad and doleful. So he dismounted and went up to him and said: \\\\\\\"What is the matter, my good man?\\\\\\\" And the man said: \\\\\\\"Well, your honour, the fact is, I've\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"five children already, and now a sixth's come, a little lass, and where to get the bread from to fill their mouths, that's more than I can say.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Don't be downhearted, my man,\\\\\\\" said the Baron. \\\\\\\"If that's your trouble, I can help you.

And when he got by the bank of the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"river Ouse, he threw the little, thing into the river, and rode off to his castle. But the little lass didn't sink; her clothes kept her up for a time, and she floated, and she floated, till she was cast ashore just in front of a fisherman's hut. There\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the fisherman found her, and took pity on the poor little thing and took her into his house, and she lived there till she was fifteen years old, and a fine handsome girl. One day it happened that the Baron went out hunting with some companions along the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"banks of the River Ouse, and stopped at the fisherman's hut to get a drink, and the girl came out to give it to them. They all noticed her beauty, and one of them said to the Baron: \\\\\\\"You can read fates, Baron, whom will she marry, d'ye think?\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Oh!\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"that's easy to guess,\\\\\\\" said the Baron; \\\\\\\"some yokel or other. But I'll cast her horoscope. Come here girl, and tell me on what day you were born?\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"I don't know, sir,\\\\\\\" said the girl, \\\\\\\"I was picked up just here after having been brought down by the river\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"about fifteen years ago.\\\\\\\" Then the Baron knew who she was, and when they went away, he rode back and said to the girl: \\\\\\\"Hark ye, girl, I will make your fortune. Take this letter to my brother in Scarborough, and you will be settled for life.\\\\\\\" And the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"girl took the letter and said she would go. Now this was what he had written in the letter: \\\\\\\"Dear Brother,--Take the bearer and put her to death immediately. \\\\\\\"Yours affectionately, \\\\\\\"Albert.\\\\\\\" So soon after the girl set out for\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Scarborough, and slept for the night at a little inn. Now that very night a band of robbers broke into the inn, and searched the girl, who had no money, and only the letter. So they opened this and read it, and thought it a shame. The captain of the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"robbers took a pen and paper and wrote this letter: \\\\\\\"Dear Brother,--Take the bearer and marry her to my son immediately. \\\\\\\"Yours affectionately, \\\\\\\"Albert.\\\\\\\" And then he gave it to the girl, bidding her begone. So she went on to the Baron's brother\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"at Scarborough, a noble knight, with whom the Baron's son was staying.

I will never see you or your son again till you desire\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"it.\\\\\\\" Then the Baron took off his gold ring and threw it into the sea, saying: \\\\\\\"Never let me see your face till you can show me that ring;\\\\\\\" and he let her go. The poor girl wandered on and on, till at last she came to a great noble's castle, and she\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"asked to have some work given to her; and they made her the scullion girl of the castle, for she had been used to such work in the fisherman's hut. Now one day, who should she see coming up to the noble's house but the Baron and his brother and his\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"son, her husband. She didn't know what to do; but thought they would not see her in the castle kitchen. So she went back to her work with a sigh, and set to cleaning a huge big fish that was to be boiled for their dinner. And, as she was cleaning it,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"she saw something shine inside it, and what do you think she found? Why, there was the Baron's ring, the very one he had thrown over the cliff at Scarborough. She was right glad to see it, you may be sure. Then she cooked the fish as nicely as she\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"could, and served it up. Well, when the fish came on the table, the guests liked it so well that they asked the noble who cooked it. He said he didn't know, but called to his servants: \\\\\\\"Ho, there, send up the cook that cooked that fine fish.\\\\\\\" So they\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"went down to the kitchen and told the girl she was wanted in the hall.

And when he got there he found a long broad road going as straight as a dart.

So she took Jack into the kitchen, and gave him a junk of bread and cheese and a jug of milk. But Jack hadn't half finished these when thump! thump! thump! the whole house began to tremble with the noise\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"of someone coming. \\\\\\\"Goodness gracious me! It's my old man,\\\\\\\" said the ogre's wife, \\\\\\\"what on earth shall I do? Here, come quick and jump in here.\\\\\\\" And she bundled Jack into the oven just as the ogre came in. He was a big one, to be sure. At his belt he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"had three calves strung up by the heels, and he unhooked them and threw them down on the table and said: \\\\\\\"Here, wife, broil me a couple of these for breakfast. Ah what's this I smell?

Here, go you and have a wash and tidy up, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"by the time you come back your breakfast'll be ready for you.\\\\\\\" So the ogre went off, and Jack was just going to jump out of the oven and run off when the woman told him not. \\\\\\\"Wait till he's asleep,\\\\\\\" says she; \\\\\\\"he always has a snooze after breakfast.\\\\\\\"\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Well, the ogre had his breakfast, and after that he goes to a big chest and takes out of it a couple of bags of gold and sits down counting them till at last his head began to nod and he began to snore till the whole house shook again. Then Jack crept\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"out on tiptoe from his oven, and as he was passing the ogre he took one of the bags of gold under his arm, and off he pelters till he came to the beanstalk, and then he threw down the bag of gold which of course fell in to his mother's garden, and then\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"he climbed down and climbed down till at last he got home and told his mother and showed her the gold and said: \\\\\\\"Well, mother, wasn't I right about the beans.

So one fine morning he got up early, and got on to the beanstalk, and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed and he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"climbed and he climbed till at last he got on the road again and came to the great big tall house he had been to before. There, sure enough, was the great big tall woman a-standing on the door-step. \\\\\\\"Good morning, mum,\\\\\\\" says Jack, as bold as\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"brass, \\\\\\\"could you be so good as to give me something to eat?\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Go away, my boy,\\\\\\\" said the big, tall woman, \\\\\\\"or else my man will eat you up for breakfast. But aren't you the youngster who came here once before? Do you know, that very day, my man missed\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"one of his bags of gold.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"That's strange, mum,\\\\\\\" says Jack, \\\\\\\"I dare say I could tell you something about that but I'm so hungry I can't speak till I've had something to eat.\\\\\\\" Well the big tall woman was that curious that she took him in and gave him\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"something to eat. But he had scarcely begun munching it as slowly as he could when thump! thump! thump! they heard the giant's footstep, and his wife hid Jack away in the oven. All happened as it did before. In came the ogre as he did before, said:\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"Fee-fi-fo-fum,\\\\\\\" and had his breakfast off three broiled oxen. Then he said: \\\\\\\"Wife, bring me the hen that lays the golden eggs.\\\\\\\" So she brought it, and the ogre said: \\\\\\\"Lay,\\\\\\\" and it laid an egg all of gold. And then the ogre began to nod his head, and to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"snore till the house shook. Then Jack crept out of the oven on tiptoe and caught hold of the golden hen, and was off before you could say \\\\\\\"Jack Robinson.\\\\\\\" But this time the hen gave a cackle which woke the ogre, and just as Jack got out of the house he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"heard him calling: \\\\\\\"Wife, wife, what have you done with my golden hen?\\\\\\\" And the wife said: \\\\\\\"Why, my dear?\\\\\\\" But that was all Jack heard, for he rushed off to the beanstalk and climbed down like a house on fire. And when he got home he showed his mother\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the wonderful hen and said \\\\\\\"Lay,\\\\\\\" to it; and it laid a golden egg every time he said \\\\\\\"Lay.\\\\\\\" Well, Jack was not content, and it wasn't very long before he determined to have another try at his luck up there at the top of the beanstalk. So one fine\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"morning, he got up early, and went on to the beanstalk, and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed till he got to the top. But this time he knew better than to go straight to the ogre's house. And when he got near it he waited behind a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"bush till he saw the ogre's wife come out with a pail to get some water, and then he crept into the house and got into the copper. He hadn't been there long when he heard thump! thump! thump! as before, and in come the ogre and his wife. \\\\\\\"Fee-fi-fo-fum,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"I smell the blood of an Englishman,\\\\\\\" cried out the ogre; \\\\\\\"I smell him, wife, I smell him.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Do you, my dearie?\\\\\\\" says the ogre's wife. \\\\\\\"Then if it's that little rogue that stole your gold and the hen that laid the golden eggs he's sure to have got into\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the oven.\\\\\\\" And they both rushed to the oven. But Jack wasn't there, luckily, and the ogre's wife said: \\\\\\\"There you are again with your fee-fi-fo-fum. Why of course it's the laddie you caught last night that I've broiled for your breakfast. How\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"forgetful I am, and how careless you are not to tell the difference between a live un and a dead un.\\\\\\\" So the ogre sat down to the breakfast and ate it, but every now and then he would mutter: \\\\\\\"Well, I could have sworn----\\\\\\\" and he'd get up and search\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the larder and the cupboards, and everything, only luckily he didn't think of the copper. After breakfast was over, the ogre called out: \\\\\\\"Wife, wife, bring me my golden harp.\\\\\\\" So she brought it and put it on the table before him. Then he said: \\\\\\\"Sing!\\\\\\\"\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and the golden harp sang most beautifully. And it went on singing till the ogre fell asleep, and commenced to snore like thunder. Then Jack lifted up the copper-lid very quietly and got down like a mouse and crept on hands and knees till he got to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the table when he got up and caught hold of the golden harp and dashed with it towards the door. But the harp called out quite loud: \\\\\\\"Master! Master!\\\\\\\" and the ogre woke up just in time to see Jack running off with his harp. Jack ran as fast as he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"could, and the ogre came rushing after, and would soon have caught him only Jack had a start and dodged him a bit and knew where he was going. When he got to the beanstalk the ogre was not more than twenty yards away when suddenly he saw Jack\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"disappear like, and when he got up to the end of the road he saw Jack underneath climbing down for dear life. Well, the ogre didn't like trusting himself to such a ladder, and he stood and waited, so Jack got another start. But just then the harp cried\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"out: \\\\\\\"Master! master!\\\\\\\" and the ogre swung himself down on to the beanstalk which shook with his weight. Down climbs Jack, and after him climbed the ogre. By this time Jack had climbed down and climbed down and climbed down till he was very nearly home.\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"So he called out: \\\\\\\"Mother! mother! bring me an axe, bring me an axe.\\\\\\\" And his mother came rushing out with the axe in her hand, but when she came to the beanstalk she stood stock still with fright for there she saw the ogre just coming down below the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"clouds. But Jack jumped down and got hold of the axe and gave a chop at the beanstalk which cut it half in two. The ogre felt the beanstalk shake and quiver so he stopped to see what was the matter. Then Jack gave another chop with the axe, and the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"beanstalk was cut in two and began to topple over. Then the ogre fell down and broke his crown, and the beanstalk came toppling after.

When she came to the henwife's she asked for eggs, as she\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"had been told to do; the henwife said to her, \\\\\\\"Lift the lid off that pot there and see.\\\\\\\" The lassie did so, but nothing happened. \\\\\\\"Go home to your minnie and tell her to keep her larder door better locked,\\\\\\\" said the henwife. So she went home to the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"queen and told her what the henwife had said. The queen knew from this that the lassie had had something to eat, so watched the next morning and sent her away fasting; but the princess saw some country-folk picking peas by the roadside, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"being very kind she spoke to them and took a handful of the peas, which she ate by the way. When she came to the henwife's, she said, \\\\\\\"Lift the lid off the pot and you'll see.\\\\\\\" So Anne lifted the lid but nothing happened. Then the henwife was rare\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"angry and said to Anne, \\\\\\\"Tell your minnie the pot won't boil if the fire's away.\\\\\\\" So Anne went home and told the queen. The third day the queen goes along with the girl herself to the henwife. Now, this time, when Anne lifted the lid off the pot, off\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"falls her own pretty head, and on jumps a sheep's head. So the queen was now quite satisfied, and went back home. Her own daughter, Kate, however, took a fine linen cloth and wrapped it round her sister's head and took her by the hand and they both\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"went out to seek their fortune. They went on, and they went on, and they went on, till they came to a castle. Kate knocked at the door and asked for a night's lodging for herself and a sick sister. They went in and found it was a king's castle, who had\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"two sons, and one of them was sickening away to death and no one could find out what ailed him. And the curious thing was that whoever watched him at night was never seen any more. So the king had offered a peck of silver to anyone who would stop up\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"with him. Now Katie was a very brave girl, so she offered to sit up with him. Till midnight all goes well. As twelve o clock rings, however, the sick prince rises, dresses himself, and slips downstairs. Kate followed, but he didn't seem to notice her.\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"The prince went to the stable, saddled his horse, called his hound, jumped into the saddle, and Kate leapt lightly up behind him. Away rode the prince and Kate through the greenwood, Kate, as they pass, plucking nuts from the trees and filling her\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"apron with them. They rode on and on till they came to a green hill. The prince here drew bridle and spoke, \\\\\\\"Open, open, green hill, and let the young prince in with his horse and his hound,\\\\\\\" and Kate added, \\\\\\\"and his lady him behind.\\\\\\\" Immediately the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"green hill opened and they passed in. The prince entered a magnificent hall, brightly lighted up, and many beautiful fairies surrounded the prince and led him off to the dance. Meanwhile, Kate, without being noticed, hid herself behind the door.\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"There she sees the prince dancing, and dancing, and dancing, till he could dance no longer and fell upon a couch. Then the fairies would fan him till he could rise again and go on dancing. At last the cock crew, and the prince made all haste to get on\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"horseback; Kate jumped up behind, and home they rode. When the morning sun rose they came in and found Kate sitting down by the fire and cracking her nuts. Kate said the prince had a good night; but she would not sit up another night unless she was to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"get a peck of gold. The second night passed as the first had done. The prince got up at midnight and rode away to the green hill and the fairy ball, and Kate went with him, gathering nuts as they rode through the forest. This time she did not watch\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the prince, for she knew he would dance and dance, and dance. But she sees a fairy baby playing with a wand, and overhears one of the fairies say: \\\\\\\"Three strokes of that wand would make Kate's sick sister as bonnie as ever she was.\\\\\\\" So Kate rolled nuts\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"to the fairy baby, and rolled nuts till the baby toddled after the nuts and let fall the wand, and Kate took it up and put it in her apron. And at cockcrow they rode home as before, and the moment Kate got home to her room she rushed and touched Anne\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"three times with the wand, and the nasty sheep's head fell off and she was her own pretty self again. The third night Kate consented to watch, only if she should marry the sick prince. All went on as on the first two nights. This time the fairy baby was\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"playing with a birdie; Kate heard one of the fairies say: \\\\\\\"Three bites of that birdie would make the sick prince as well as ever he was.\\\\\\\" Kate rolled all the nuts she had to the fairy baby till the birdie was dropped, and Kate put it in her apron. At\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"cockcrow they set off again, but instead of cracking her nuts as she used to do, this time Kate plucked the feathers off and cooked the birdie. Soon there arose a very savoury smell. \\\\\\\"Oh!\\\\\\\" said the sick prince, \\\\\\\"I wish I had a bite of that birdie,\\\\\\\" so\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Kate gave him a bite of the birdie, and he rose up on his elbow. By-and-by he cried out again: \\\\\\\"Oh, if I had another bite of that birdie!\\\\\\\" so Kate gave him another bite, and he sat up on his bed. Then he said again: \\\\\\\"Oh! if I only had a third bite of\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"that birdie!\\\\\\\" So Kate gave him a third bite, and he rose quite well, dressed himself, and sat down by the fire, and when the folk came in next morning they found Kate and the young prince cracking nuts together. Meanwhile his brother had seen Annie and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"had fallen in love with her, as everybody did who saw her sweet pretty face. So the sick son married the well sister, and the well son married the sick sister, and they all lived happy and died happy, and never drank out of a dry cappy.\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

So on Saturday, Jack hired himself to a butcher, who rewarded him by the handsome present of a shoulder of mutton.

She noticed that before they went to bed the giant put straw ropes round her neck and her sisters', and round his own lassies' necks he put gold chains. So Molly took care and did\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"not fall asleep, but waited till she was sure every one was sleeping sound.

So back she goes to the giant's house, and hides herself below the bed. The giant wasn't long ere he came home, and, after he had eaten a great big supper, he went to his bed, and shortly was snoring loud. Molly crept out and reached over the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"bed, and got hold of the giant's hand, and she pulled and she pulled until she got off the ring; but just as she got it off the giant got up, and gripped her by the hand, and he says: \\\\\\\"Now I have catcht you, Molly Whuppie, and, if I had done as much ill\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"to you as ye have done to me, what would ye do to me?\\\\\\\" Molly says: \\\\\\\"I would put you into a sack, and I'd put the cat inside with you, and the dog aside you, and a needle and thread and a shears, and I'd hang you up upon the wall, and I'd go to the wood,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and choose the thickest stick I could get, and I would come home, and take you down, and bang you till you were dead.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Well, Molly,\\\\\\\" says the giant, \\\\\\\"I'll just do that to you.\\\\\\\" So he gets a sack, and puts Molly into it, and the cat and the dog beside\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"her, and a needle and thread and shears, and hangs her up upon the wall, and goes to the wood to choose a stick. Molly she sings out: \\\\\\\"Oh, if ye saw what I see.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Oh,\\\\\\\" says the giant's wife, \\\\\\\"what do ye see, Molly?\\\\\\\" But Molly never said a word but, \\\\\\\"Oh,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"if ye saw what I see!\\\\\\\" The giant's wife begged that Molly would take her up into the sack till she would see what Molly saw. So Molly took the shears and cut a hole in the sack, and took out the needle and thread with her, and jumped down and helped,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the giant's wife up into the sack, and sewed up the hole. The giant's wife saw nothing, and began to ask to get down again; but Molly never minded, but hid herself at the back of the door.

They were both very, very tired, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Mr. Vinegar said: \\\\\\\"My love, I will climb up into a tree, drag up the door, and you shall follow.\\\\\\\" He accordingly did so, and they both stretched their weary limbs on the door, and fell fast asleep.

Away scampered the thieves, but Mr. Vinegar dared not quit his retreat\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"till broad daylight. He then scrambled out of the tree, and went to lift up the door. What did he see but a number of golden guineas. \\\\\\\"Come down, Mrs. Vinegar,\\\\\\\" he cried; \\\\\\\"come down, I say; our fortune's made, our fortune's made! Come down, I say.\\\\\\\"\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Mrs. Vinegar got down as fast as she could, and when she saw the money she jumped for joy. \\\\\\\"Now, my dear,\\\\\\\" said she, \\\\\\\"I'll tell you what you shall do.

I can\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"make butter and cheese, which you shall sell at market, and we shall then be able to live very comfortably.\\\\\\\" Mr. Vinegar joyfully agrees, takes the money, and off he goes to the fair. When he arrived, he walked up and down, and at length saw a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"beautiful red cow. It was an excellent milker, and perfect in every way. \\\\\\\"Oh,\\\\\\\" thought Mr. Vinegar, \\\\\\\"if I had but that cow, I should be the happiest, man alive.\\\\\\\" So he offers the forty guineas for the cow, and the owner said that, as he was a friend,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"he'd oblige him.

So the beautiful red cow was given for the bagpipes.

He put\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"on the gloves, and felt perfectly happy as he trudged homewards. At last he grew very tired, when he saw a man coming towards him with a good stout stick in his hand. \\\\\\\"Oh,\\\\\\\" said Mr. Vinegar, \\\\\\\"that I had but that stick! I should then be the happiest man\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"alive.\\\\\\\" He said to the man: \\\\\\\"Friend! what a rare good stick you have got.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Yes,\\\\\\\" said the man; \\\\\\\"I have used it for many a long mile, and a good friend it has been; but if you have a fancy for it, as you are a friend, I don't mind giving it to you for\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"that pair of gloves.\\\\\\\" Mr. Vinegar's hands were so warm, and his legs so tired, that he gladly made the exchange. As he drew near to the wood where he had left his wife, he heard a parrot on a tree calling out his name: \\\\\\\"Mr. Vinegar, you foolish man, you\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"blockhead, you simpleton; you went to the fair, and laid out all your money in buying a cow.

So his cake was very small; yet small as it was, his mother asked him if he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"was willing to take the half of it with her blessing, telling him that, if he chose rather to take the whole, he would only get it with her curse.

So the young man went to seek his fortune. And he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"went all that day, and all the next day; and on the third day, in the afternoon, he came up to where a shepherd was sitting with a flock of sheep. And he went up to the shepherd and asked him who the sheep belonged to; and he answered: \\\\\\\"The Red Ettin of\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Ireland Once lived in Ballygan, And stole King Malcolm's daughter The king of fair Scotland.

So the young man went on, and by-and-by he saw a multitude of very dreadful beasts, with two heads, and on every head four horns. And he was sore frightened, and ran away from them as fast as he could; and glad was he when he came to a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"castle that stood on a hillock, with the door standing wide open to the wall. And he went into the castle for shelter, and there he saw an old wife sitting beside the kitchen fire. He asked the wife if he might stay for the night, as he was tired with\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"a long journey; and the wife said he might, but it was not a good place for him to be in, as it belonged to the Red Ettin, who was a very terrible beast, with three heads, that spared no living man it could get hold of. The young man would have gone\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"away, but he was afraid of the beasts on the outside of the castle; so he beseeched the old woman to hide him as best she could, and not tell the Ettin he was there. He thought, if he could put over the night, he might get away in the morning, without\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"meeting with the beasts, and so escape. But he had not been long in his hiding-hole, before the awful Ettin came in; and no sooner was he in, than he was heard crying: \\\\\\\"Snouk but and snouk ben, I find the smell of an earthly man, Be he living, or be he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"dead, His heart this night shall kitchen my bread.\\\\\\\" The monster soon found the poor young man, and pulled him from his hole. And when he had got him out, he told him that if he could answer him three questions his life should be spared. So the first\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"head asked: \\\\\\\"A thing without an end, what's that?\\\\\\\" But the young man knew not. Then the second head said: \\\\\\\"The smaller, the more dangerous, what's that?\\\\\\\" But the young man knew it not. And then the third head asked: \\\\\\\"The dead carrying the living; riddle\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"me that?\\\\\\\" But the young man had to give it up. The lad not being able to answer one of these questions, the Red Ettin took a mallet and knocked him on the head, and turned him into a pillar of stone. On the morning after this happened, the younger\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"brother took out the knife to look at it, and he was grieved to find it all brown with rust. He told his mother that the time was now come for him to go away upon his travels also; so she requested him to take the can to the well for water, that she\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"might make a cake for him. And he went, and as he was bringing home the water, a raven over his head cried to him to look, and he would see that the water was running out. And he was a young man of sense, and seeing the water running out, he took some\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"clay and patched up the holes, so that he brought home enough water to bake a large cake. When his mother put it to him to take the half cake with her blessing, he took it in preference to having the whole with her malison; and yet the half was bigger\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"than what the other lad had got. So he went away on his journey; and after he had travelled a far way, he met with an old woman that asked him if be would give her a bit of his johnny-cake. And he said: \\\\\\\"I will gladly do that,\\\\\\\" and so he gave her a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"piece of the johnny-cake; and for that she gave him a magical wand, that she might yet be of service to him, if he took care to use it rightly. Then the old woman, who was a fairy, told him a great deal that would happen to him, and what he ought to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"do in all circumstances; and after that she vanished in an instant out of his sight. He went on a great way farther, and then he came up to the old man herding the sheep; and when he asked whose sheep these were, the answer was:\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"The Red Ettin of Ireland Once lived in Ballygan, And stole King Malcolm's daughter, The king of Fair Scotland. \\\\\\\"He beats her, he binds her, He lays her on a band; And every day he strikes her With a bright silver wand.

One came up roaring with open mouth to devour him, when he struck it with his wand, and laid it in an instant dead at his feet. He soon came to the Ettin's castle, where he knocked, and was admitted. The old woman who sat by the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"fire warned him of the terrible Ettin, and what had been the fate of his brother; but he was not to be daunted. The monster soon came in, saying: \\\\\\\"Snouk but and snouk ben, I find the smell of an earthly man; Be he living, or be he dead, His heart shall\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"be kitchen to my bread.\\\\\\\" He quickly espied the young man, and bade him come forth on the floor. And then he put the three questions to him; but the young man had been told everything by the good fairy, so he was able to answer all the questions.\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"So when the first head asked, \\\\\\\"What's the thing without an end?\\\\\\\" he said: \\\\\\\"A bowl.\\\\\\\" And when the second head said: \\\\\\\"The smaller the more dangerous; what's that?\\\\\\\" he said at once, \\\\\\\"A bridge.\\\\\\\" And last, the third head said: \\\\\\\"When does the dead carry the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"living, riddle me that?\\\\\\\" Then the young man answered up at once and said: \\\\\\\"When a ship sails on the sea with men inside her.\\\\\\\" When the Ettin found this, he knew that his power was gone. The young man then took up an axe and hewed off the monster's three\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"heads. He next asked the old woman to show him where the king's daughter lay; and the old woman took him upstairs, and opened a great many doors, and out of every door came a beautiful lady who had been imprisoned there by the Ettin; and one of the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"ladies was the king's daughter. She also took him down into a low room, and there stood a stone pillar, that he had only to touch with his wand, when his brother started into life.

One day, after they\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"had made the porridge for their breakfast, and poured it into their porridge-pots, they walked out into the wood while the porridge was cooling, that they might not burn their mouths, by beginning too soon to eat it.

So the little old Woman opened the door, and went in; and well pleased she was when she saw the porridge on the table. If\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"she had been a good little old Woman, she would have waited till the Bears came home, and then, perhaps, they would have asked her to breakfast; for they were good Bears--a little rough or so, as the manner of Bears is, but for all that very\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"good-natured and hospitable.

And then she sate down in the chair of the Middle Bear, and that was too soft for her.

So she seated herself in it,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and there she sate till the bottom of the chair came out, and down she came, plump upon the ground.

Then he said: \\\\\\\"Whatever are you three doing, sitting there crying, and letting the beer run all over the floor?\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Oh!\\\\\\\" says the father, \\\\\\\"look at\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"that horrid mallet!

Well,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"he set out, and he travelled a long way, and at last he came to a woman's cottage that had some grass growing on the roof. And the woman was trying to get her cow to go up a ladder to the grass, and the poor thing durst not go. So the gentleman asked\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the woman what she was doing. \\\\\\\"Why, lookye,\\\\\\\" she said, \\\\\\\"look at all that beautiful grass. I'm going to get the cow on to the roof to eat it.

And the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"gentleman went on and on, and he went to an inn to stop the night, and they were so full at the inn that they had to put him in a double-bedded room, and another traveller was to sleep in the other bed.

At last he stopped and wiped his face with his handkerchief. \\\\\\\"Oh dear,\\\\\\\" he says, \\\\\\\"I do think trousers are the most awkwardest kind of clothes that ever\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"were. I can't think who could have invented such things. It takes me the best part of an hour to get into mine every morning, and I get so hot!

Then the gentleman went on his travels again; and he came to a village, and outside the village there was a pond, and round the pond\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"was a crowd of people. And they had got rakes, and brooms, and pitchforks, reaching into the pond; and the gentleman asked what was the matter. \\\\\\\"Why,\\\\\\\" they say, \\\\\\\"matter enough!

So there was a whole\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"lot of sillies bigger than them three sillies at home.

Suddenly she heard a croaking voice, and she looked up and saw a great frog with goggle eyes looking at her and speaking to her. \\\\\\\"What's the matter, dearie?\\\\\\\" it said. \\\\\\\"Oh, dear, oh dear,\\\\\\\" she said, \\\\\\\"my stepmother has\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"sent me all this long way to fill this sieve with water from the Well of the World's End, and I can't fill it no how at all.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Well,\\\\\\\" said the frog, \\\\\\\"if you promise me to do whatever I bid you for a whole night long, I'll tell you how to fill it.\\\\\\\" So\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the girl agreed, and then the frog said: \\\\\\\"Stop it with moss and daub it with clay, And then it will carry the water away;\\\\\\\" and then it gave a hop, skip and jump, and went flop into the Well of the World's End. So the girl looked about for some moss, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"lined the bottom of the sieve with it, and over that she put some clay, and then she dipped it once again into the Well of the World's End; and this time, the water didn't run out, and she turned to go away. Just then the frog popped up its head out of\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the Well of the World's End, and said: \\\\\\\"Remember your promise.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"All right,\\\\\\\" said the girl; for thought she, \\\\\\\"what harm can a frog do me?\\\\\\\" So she went back to her stepmother, and brought the sieve full of water from the Well of the World's End. The\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"stepmother was fine and angry, but she said nothing at all. That very evening they heard something tap tapping at the door low down, and a voice cried out: \\\\\\\"Open the door, my hinny, my heart, Open the door, my own darling; Mind you the words that you\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and I spoke, Down in the meadow, at the World's End Well.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Whatever can that be?\\\\\\\" cried out the stepmother, and the girl had to tell her all about it, and what she had promised the frog. \\\\\\\"Girls must keep their promises,\\\\\\\" said the stepmother. \\\\\\\"Go and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"open the door this instant.\\\\\\\" For she was glad the girl would have to obey a nasty frog. So the girl went and opened the door, and there was the frog from the Well of the World's End. And it hopped, and it skipped, and it jumped, till it reached the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"girl, and then it said: \\\\\\\"Lift me to your knee, my hinny, my heart; Lift me to your knee, my own darling; Remember the words you and I spoke, Down in the meadow by the World's End Well.\\\\\\\" But the girl didn't like to, till her stepmother said \\\\\\\"Lift it up\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"this instant, you hussy! Girls must keep their promises!\\\\\\\" So at last she lifted the frog up on to her lap, and it lay there for a time, till at last it said: \\\\\\\"Give me some supper, my hinny, my heart, Give me some supper, my darling; Remember the words\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"you and I spake, In the meadow, by the Well of the World's End.\\\\\\\" Well, she didn't mind doing that, so she got it a bowl of milk and bread, and fed it well. And when the frog, had finished, it said: \\\\\\\"Go with me to bed, my hinny, my heart, Go with me to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"bed, my own darling; Mind you the words you spake to me, Down by the cold well, so weary.\\\\\\\" But that the girl wouldn't do, till her stepmother said: \\\\\\\"Do what you promised, girl; girls must keep their promises. Do what you're bid, or out you go, you and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"your froggie.\\\\\\\" So the girl took the frog with her to bed, and kept it as far away from her as she could. Well, just as the day was beginning to break what should the frog say but: \\\\\\\"Chop off my head, my hinny, my heart, Chop off my head, my own darling;\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Remember the promise you made to me, Down by the cold well so weary.\\\\\\\" At first the girl wouldn't, for she thought of what the frog had done for her at the Well of the World's End. But when the frog said the words over again, she went and took an axe and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"chopped off its head, and lo! and behold, there stood before her a handsome young prince, who told her that he had been enchanted by a wicked magician, and he could never be unspelled till some girl would do his bidding for a whole night, and chop\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"off his head at the end of it. The stepmother was that surprised when she found the young prince instead of the nasty frog, and she wasn't best pleased, you may be sure, when the prince told her that he was going to marry her stepdaughter\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"because she had unspelled him. So they were married and went away to live in the castle of the king, his father, and all the stepmother had to console her was, that it was all through her that her stepdaughter was married to a prince.\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

Their only neighbor was a bad and malicious badger. This badger used to come out every night and run across to the farmer's field and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"spoil the vegetables and the rice which the farmer spent his time in carefully cultivating. The badger at last grew so ruthless in his mischievous work, and did so much harm everywhere on the farm, that the good-natured farmer could not\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"stand it any longer, and determined to put a stop to it. So he lay in wait day after day and night after night, with a big club, hoping to catch the badger, but all in vain. Then he laid traps for the wicked animal. The farmer's trouble and patience\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"was rewarded, for one fine day on going his rounds he found the badger caught in a hole he had dug for that purpose. The farmer was delighted at having caught his enemy, and carried him home securely bound with rope. When he reached the house the farmer\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"said to his wife: \\\\\\\"I have at last caught the bad badger. You must keep an eye on him while I am out at work and not let him escape, because I want to make him into soup to-night.\\\\\\\" Saying this, he hung the badger up to the rafters of his storehouse and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"went out to his work in the fields. The badger was in great distress, for he did not at all like the idea of being made into soup that night, and he thought and thought for a long time, trying to hit upon some plan by which he might escape. It was hard\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"to think clearly in his uncomfortable position, for he had been hung upside down. Very near him, at the entrance to the storehouse, looking out towards the green fields and the trees and the pleasant sunshine, stood the farmer's old wife pounding\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"barley. She looked tired and old. Her face was seamed with many wrinkles, and was as brown as leather, and every now and then she stopped to wipe the perspiration which rolled down her face. \\\\\\\"Dear lady,\\\\\\\" said the wily badger, \\\\\\\"you must be very\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"weary doing such heavy work in your old age. Won't you let me do that for you? My arms are very strong, and I could relieve you for a little while!\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Thank you for your kindness,\\\\\\\" said the old woman, \\\\\\\"but I cannot let you do this work for me\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"because I must not untie you, for you might escape if I did, and my husband would be very angry if he came home and found you gone.\\\\\\\" Now, the badger is one of the most cunning of animals, and he said again in a very sad, gentle, voice: \\\\\\\"You are very\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"unkind. You might untie me, for I promise not to try to escape. If you are afraid of your husband, I will let you bind me again before his return when I have finished pounding the barley. I am so tired and sore tied up like this. If you would only let\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"me down for a few minutes I would indeed be thankful!\\\\\\\" The old woman had a good and simple nature, and could not think badly of any one. Much less did she think that the badger was only deceiving her in order to get away. She felt sorry, too, for the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"animal as she turned to look at him. He looked in such a sad plight hanging downwards from the ceiling by his legs, which were all tied together so tightly that the rope and the knots were cutting into the skin. So in the kindness of her heart, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"believing the creature's promise that he would not run away, she untied the cord and let him down. The old woman then gave him the wooden pestle and told him to do the work for a short time while she rested. He took the pestle, but instead of doing\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the work as he was told, the badger at once sprang upon the old woman and knocked her down with the heavy piece of wood. He then killed her and cut her up and made soup of her, and waited for the return of the old farmer. The old man worked hard in his\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"fields all day, and as he worked he thought with pleasure that no more now would his labor be spoiled by the destructive badger. Towards sunset he left his work and turned to go home. He was very tired, but the thought of the nice supper of hot badger\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"soup awaiting his return cheered him. The thought that the badger might get free and take revenge on the poor old woman never once came into his mind. The badger meanwhile assumed the old woman's form, and as soon as he saw the old farmer approaching\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"came out to greet him on the veranda of the little house, saying: \\\\\\\"So you have come back at last. I have made the badger soup and have been waiting for you for a long time.\\\\\\\" The old farmer quickly took off his straw sandals and sat down before his tiny\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"dinner-tray. The innocent man never even dreamed that it was not his wife but the badger who was waiting upon him, and asked at once for the soup. Then the badger suddenly transformed himself back to his natural form and cried out: \\\\\\\"You wife-eating\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"old man! Look out for the bones in the kitchen!\\\\\\\" Laughing loudly and derisively he escaped out of the house and ran away to his den in the hills. The old man was left behind alone. He could hardly believe what he had seen and heard. Then when he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"understood the whole truth he was so scared and horrified that he fainted right away. After a while he came round and burst into tears. He cried loudly and bitterly. He rocked himself to and fro in his hopeless grief. It seemed too terrible to be real\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"that his faithful old wife had been killed and cooked by the badger while he was working quietly in the fields, knowing nothing of what was going on at home, and congratulating himself on having once for all got rid of the wicked animal who had so often\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"spoiled his fields. And oh! the horrible thought; he had very nearly drunk the soup which the creature had made of his poor old woman. \\\\\\\"Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear!\\\\\\\" he wailed aloud. Now, not far away there lived in the same mountain a kind,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"good-natured old rabbit. He heard the old man crying and sobbing and at once set out to see what was the matter, and if there was anything he could do to help his neighbor. The old man told him all that had happened. When the rabbit heard the story he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"was very angry at the wicked and deceitful badger, and told the old man to leave everything to him and he would avenge his wife's death. The farmer was at last comforted, and, wiping away his tears, thanked the rabbit for his goodness in coming to him\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"in his distress. The rabbit, seeing that the farmer was growing calmer, went back to his home to lay his plans for the punishment of the badger. The next day the weather was fine, and the rabbit went out to find the badger. He was not to be seen in the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"woods or on the hillside or in the fields anywhere, so the rabbit went to his den and found the badger hiding there, for the animal had been afraid to show himself ever since he had escaped from the farmer's house, for fear of the old man's wrath. The\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"rabbit called out: \\\\\\\"Why are you not out on such a beautiful day? Come out with me, and we will go and cut grass on the hills together.\\\\\\\" The badger, never doubting but that the rabbit was his friend, willingly consented to go out with him, only too glad\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"to get away from the neighborhood of the farmer and the fear of meeting him. The rabbit led the way miles away from their homes, out on the hills where the grass grew tall and thick and sweet. They both set to work to cut down as much as they could\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"carry home, to store it up for their winter's food. When they had each cut down all they wanted they tied it in bundles and then started homewards, each carrying his bundle of grass on his back. This time the rabbit made the badger go first. When they\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"had gone a little way the rabbit took out a flint and steel, and, striking it over the badger's back as he stepped along in front, set his bundle of grass on fire. The badger heard the flint striking, and asked: \\\\\\\"What is that noise. 'Crack, crack'?\\\\\\\"\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"Oh, that is nothing.\\\\\\\" replied the rabbit; \\\\\\\"I only said 'Crack, crack' because this mountain is called Crackling Mountain.\\\\\\\" The fire soon spread in the bundle of dry grass on the badger's back. The badger, hearing the crackle of the burning grass,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"asked, \\\\\\\"What is that?\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Now we have come to the 'Burning Mountain,'\\\\\\\" answered the rabbit. By this time the bundle was nearly burned out and all the hair had been burned off the badger's back. He now knew what had happened by the smell of the smoke\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"of the burning grass. Screaming with pain the badger ran as fast as he could to his hole. The rabbit followed and found him lying on his bed groaning with pain. \\\\\\\"What an unlucky fellow you are!\\\\\\\" said the rabbit. \\\\\\\"I can't imagine how this happened! I\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"will bring you some medicine which will heal your back quickly!\\\\\\\" The rabbit went away glad and smiling to think that the punishment upon the badger had already begun. He hoped that the badger would die of his burns, for he felt that nothing could\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"be too bad for the animal, who was guilty of murdering a poor helpless old woman who had trusted him. He went home and made an ointment by mixing some sauce and red pepper together. He carried this to the badger, but before putting it on he told him\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"that it would cause him great pain, but that he must bear it patiently, because it was a very wonderful medicine for burns and scalds and such wounds. The badger thanked him and begged him to apply it at once. But no language can describe the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"agony of the badger as soon as the red pepper had been pasted all over his sore back. He rolled over and over and howled loudly. The rabbit, looking on, felt that the farmer's wife was beginning to be avenged. The badger was in bed for about a month;\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"but at last, in spite of the red pepper application, his burns healed and he got well. When the rabbit saw that the badger was getting well, he thought of another plan by which he could compass the creature's death. So he went one day to pay the badger\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"a visit and to congratulate him on his recovery. During the conversation the rabbit mentioned that he was going fishing, and described how pleasant fishing was when the weather was fine and the sea smooth. The badger listened with pleasure to the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"rabbit's account of the way he passed his time now, and forgot all his pains and his month's illness, and thought what fun it would be if he could go fishing too; so he asked the rabbit if he would take him the next time he went out to fish. This was\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"just what the rabbit wanted, so he agreed. Then he went home and built two boats, one of wood and the other of clay. At last they were both finished, and as the rabbit stood and looked at his work he felt that all his trouble would be well rewarded\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"if his plan succeeded, and he could manage to kill the wicked badger now. The day came when the rabbit had arranged to take the badger fishing. He kept the wooden boat himself and gave the badger the clay boat. The badger, who knew nothing\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"about boats, was delighted with his new boat and thought how kind it was of the rabbit to give it to him. They both got into their boats and set out. After going some distance from the shore the rabbit proposed that they should try their boats and see\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"which one could go the quickest. The badger fell in with the proposal, and they both set to work to row as fast as they could for some time. In the middle of the race the badger found his boat going to pieces, for the water now began to soften the clay.\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"He cried out in great fear to the rabbit to help him. But the rabbit answered that he was avenging the old woman's murder, and that this had been his intention all along, and that he was happy to think that the badger had at last met his deserts for all\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"his evil crimes, and was to drown with no one to help him. Then he raised his oar and struck at the badger with all his strength till he fell with the sinking clay boat and was seen no more. Thus at last he kept his promise to the old farmer. The rabbit\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"now turned and rowed shorewards, and having landed and pulled his boat upon the beach, hurried back to tell the old farmer everything, and how the badger, his enemy, had been killed. The old farmer thanked him with tears in his eyes. He said that till\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"now he could never sleep at night or be at peace in the daytime, thinking of how his wife's death was unavenged, but from this time he would be able to sleep and eat as of old. He begged the rabbit to stay with him and share his home, so from this day\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the rabbit went to stay with the old farmer and they both lived together as good friends to the end of their days.\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

He had walked the whole day and was now tired and hungry, and the evenings were chilly, for it was late autumn, and he began to be very anxious to find some house\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"where he could obtain a night's lodging. He found himself lost in the midst of the large plain, and looked about in vain for some sign of human habitation. At last, after wandering about for some hours, he saw a clump of trees in the distance, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"through the trees he caught sight of the glimmer of a single ray of light. He exclaimed with joy: \\\\\\\"Oh. surely that is some cottage where I can get a night's lodging!\\\\\\\" Keeping the light before his eyes he dragged his weary, aching feet as quickly as he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"could towards the spot, and soon came to a miserable-looking little cottage. As he drew near he saw that it was in a tumble-down condition, the bamboo fence was broken and weeds and grass pushed their way through the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"gaps. The paper screens which serve as windows and doors in Japan were full of holes, and the posts of the house were bent with age and seemed scarcely able to support the old thatched roof. The hut was open, and by the light of an old lantern an old\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"woman sat industriously spinning. The pilgrim called to her across the bamboo fence and said: \\\\\\\"O Baa San (old woman), good evening! I am a traveler! Please excuse me, but I have lost my way and do not know what to do, for I have\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"nowhere to rest to-night. I beg you to be good enough to let me spend the night under your roof.\\\\\\\" The old woman as soon as she heard herself spoken to stopped spinning, rose from her seat and approached the intruder. \\\\\\\"I am very sorry for you.\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"You must indeed be distressed to have lost your way in such a lonely spot so late at night. Unfortunately I cannot put you up, for I have no bed to offer you, and no accommodation whatsoever for a guest in this poor place!\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Oh, that\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"does not matter,\\\\\\\" said the priest; \\\\\\\"all I want is a shelter under some roof for the night, and if you will be good enough just to let me lie on the kitchen floor I shall be grateful. I am too tired to walk further to-night, so I hope you will not\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"refuse me, otherwise I shall have to sleep out on the cold plain.\\\\\\\" And in this way he pressed the old woman to let him stay. She seemed very reluctant, but at last she said: \\\\\\\"Very well, I will let you stay here. I can offer you a very poor welcome only,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"but come in now and I will make a fire, for the night is cold.\\\\\\\" The pilgrim was only too glad to do as he was told. He took off his sandals and entered the hut. The old woman then brought some sticks of wood and lit the fire, and bade her guest draw\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"near and warm himself. \\\\\\\"You must be hungry after your long tramp,\\\\\\\" said the old woman. \\\\\\\"I will go and cook some supper for you.\\\\\\\" She then went to the kitchen to cook some rice. After the priest had finished his supper the old woman sat down by the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"fire-place, and they talked together for a long time. The pilgrim thought to himself that he had been very lucky to come across such a kind, hospitable old woman. At last the wood gave out, and as the fire died slowly down he began to shiver with cold\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"just as he had done when he arrived. \\\\\\\"I see you are cold,\\\\\\\" said the old woman; \\\\\\\"I will go out and gather some wood, for we have used it all. You must stay and take care of the house while I am gone.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"No, no,\\\\\\\" said the pilgrim, \\\\\\\"let me go instead, for\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"you are old, and I cannot think of letting you go out to get wood for me this cold night!\\\\\\\" The old woman shook her head and said: \\\\\\\"You must stay quietly here, for you are my guest.\\\\\\\" Then she left him and went out. In a minute she came back and said:\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"You must sit where you are and not move, and whatever happens don't go near or look into the inner room. Now mind what I tell you!\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"If you tell me not to go near the back room, of course I won't,\\\\\\\" said the priest, rather bewildered. The old woman\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"then went out again, and the priest was left alone. The fire had died out, and the only light in the hut was that of a dim lantern. For the first time that night he began to feel that he was in a weird place, and the old woman's words, \\\\\\\"Whatever you do\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"don't peep into the back room,\\\\\\\" aroused his curiosity and his fear. What hidden thing could be in that room that she did not wish him to see? For some time the remembrance of his promise to the old woman kept him still, but at last he could no longer\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"resist his curiosity to peep into the forbidden place. He got up and began to move slowly towards the back room. Then the thought that the old woman would be very angry with him if he disobeyed her made him come back to his place by the fireside. As the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"minutes went slowly by and the old woman did not return, he began to feel more and more frightened, and to wonder what dreadful secret was in the room behind him. He must find out. \\\\\\\"She will not know that I have looked unless I tell her. I will just\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"have a peep before she comes back,\\\\\\\" said the man to himself. With these words he got up on his feet (for he had been sitting all this time in Japanese fashion with his feet under him) and stealthily crept towards the forbidden spot. With trembling hands\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"he pushed back the sliding door and looked in. What he saw froze the blood in his veins. The room was full of dead men's bones and the walls were splashed and the floor was covered with human blood. In one corner skull upon skull rose to the ceiling, in\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"another was a heap of arm bones, in another a heap of leg bones. The sickening smell made him faint. He fell backwards with horror, and for some time lay in a heap with fright on the floor, a pitiful sight. He trembled all over and his teeth chattered,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and he could hardly crawl away from the dreadful spot. \\\\\\\"How horrible!\\\\\\\" he cried out. \\\\\\\"What awful den have I come to in my travels? May Buddha help me or I am lost. Is it possible that that kind old woman is really the cannibal goblin? When she comes\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"back she will show herself in her true character and eat me up at one mouthful!\\\\\\\" With these words his strength came back to him and, snatching up his hat and staff, he rushed out of the house as fast as his legs could carry him. Out into the night he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"ran, his one thought to get as far as he could from the goblin's haunt. He had not gone far when he heard steps behind him and a voice crying: \\\\\\\"Stop! stop!\\\\\\\" He ran on, redoubling his speed, pretending not to hear. As he ran he heard the steps behind him\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"come nearer and nearer, and at last he recognized the old woman's voice which grew louder and louder as she came nearer. \\\\\\\"Stop! stop, you wicked man, why did you look into the forbidden room?\\\\\\\" The priest quite forgot how tired he was and his feet flew\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"over the ground faster than ever. Fear gave him strength, for he knew that if the goblin caught him he would soon be one of her victims. With all his heart he repeated the prayer to Buddha: \\\\\\\"Namu Amida Butsu, Namu Amida Butsu.\\\\\\\" And after\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"him rushed the dreadful old hag, her hair flying in the wind, and her face changing with rage into the demon that she was. In her hand she carried a large blood-stained knife, and she still shrieked after him, \\\\\\\"Stop! stop!\\\\\\\" At last, when the priest\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"felt he could run no more, the dawn broke, and with the darkness of night the goblin vanished and he was safe. The priest now knew that he had met the Goblin of Adachigahara, the story of whom he had often heard but never believed to be true. He felt\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"that he owed his wonderful escape to the protection of Buddha to whom he had prayed for help, so he took out his rosary and bowing his head as the sun rose he said his prayers and made his thanksgiving earnestly. He then set forward for\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"another part of the country, only too glad to leave the haunted plain behind him.\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

This lump was a great disfigurement to the old man, and so annoyed him that for many years he spent all his time and money in trying to get\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"rid of it. He tried everything he could think of. He consulted many doctors far and near, and took all kinds of medicines both internally and externally. But it was all of no use. The lump only grew bigger and bigger till it was nearly as big as his\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"face, and in despair he gave up all hopes of ever losing it, and resigned himself to the thought of having to carry the lump on his face all his life. One day the firewood gave out in his kitchen, so, as his wife wanted some at once, the old man took\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"his ax and set out for the woods up among the hills not very far from his home. It was a fine day in the early autumn, and the old man enjoyed the fresh air and was in no hurry to get home. So the whole afternoon passed quickly while he was chopping\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"wood, and he had collected a goodly pile to take back to his wife. When the day began to draw to a close, he turned his face homewards. The old man had not gone far on his way down the mountain pass when the sky clouded and rain began to fall heavily.\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"He looked about for some shelter, but there was not even a charcoal-burner's hut near. At last he espied a large hole in the hollow trunk of a tree. The hole was near the ground, so he crept in easily, and sat down in hopes that he had only been\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"overtaken by a mountain shower, and that the weather would soon clear. But much to the old man's disappointment, instead of clearing the rain fell more and more heavily, and finally a heavy thunderstorm broke over the mountain. The thunder\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"roared so terrifically, and the heavens seemed to be so ablaze with lightning, that the old man could hardly believe himself to be alive. He thought that he must die of fright. At last, however, the sky cleared, and the whole country was aglow in the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"rays of the setting sun. The old man's spirits revived when he looked out at the beautiful twilight, and he was about to step out from his strange hiding-place in the hollow tree when the sound of what seemed like the approaching steps of several people\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"caught his ear. He at once thought that his friends had come to look for him, and he was delighted at the idea of having some jolly companions with whom to walk home. But on looking out from the tree, what was his amazement to see, not his friends, but\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"hundreds of demons coming towards the spot. The more he looked, the greater was his astonishment. Some of these demons were as large as giants, others had great big eyes out of all proportion to the rest of their bodies, others again had\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"absurdly long noses, and some had such big mouths that they seemed to open from ear to ear. All had horns growing on their foreheads. The old man was so surprised at what he saw that he lost his balance and fell out of the hollow tree. Fortunately for\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"him the demons did not see him, as the tree was in the background. So he picked himself up and crept back into the tree. While he was sitting there and wondering impatiently when he would be able to get home, he heard the sounds of gay music, and then\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"some of the demons began to sing. \\\\\\\"What are these creatures doing?\\\\\\\" said the old man to himself. \\\\\\\"I will look out, it sounds very amusing.\\\\\\\" On peeping out, the old man saw that the demon chief himself was actually sitting with his back against the tree\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"in which he had taken refuge, and all the other demons were sitting round, some drinking and some dancing. Food and wine was spread before them on the ground, and the demons were evidently having a great entertainment and enjoying\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"themselves immensely. It made the old man laugh to see their strange antics. \\\\\\\"How amusing this is!\\\\\\\" laughed the old man to himself \\\\\\\"I am now quite old, but I have never seen anything so strange in all my life.\\\\\\\" He was so interested and excited in\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"watching all that the demons were doing, that he forgot himself and stepped out of the tree and stood looking on. The demon chief was just taking a big cup of SAKE and watching one of the demons dancing. In a little while he said with a bored air: \\\\\\\"Your\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"dance is rather monotonous. I am tired of watching it. Isn't there any one amongst you all who can dance better than this fellow?\\\\\\\" Now the old man had been fond of dancing all his life, and was quite an expert in the art, and he knew that he could do\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"much better than the demon. \\\\\\\"Shall I go and dance before these demons and let them see what a human being can do? It may be dangerous, for if I don't please them they may kill me!\\\\\\\" said the old fellow to himself. His fears, however, were soon overcome\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"by his love of dancing. In a few minutes he could restrain himself no longer, and came out before the whole party of demons and began to dance at once. The old man, realizing that his life probably depended on whether he pleased these\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"strange creatures or not, exerted his skill and wit to the utmost. The demons were at first very surprised to see a man so fearlessly taking part in their entertainment, and then their surprise soon gave place to admiration. \\\\\\\"How strange!\\\\\\\"\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"exclaimed the horned chief. \\\\\\\"I never saw such a skillful dancer before! He dances admirably!\\\\\\\" When the old man had finished his dance, the big demon said: \\\\\\\"Thank you very much for your amusing dance. Now give us the pleasure of drinking a cup of wine\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"with us,\\\\\\\" and with these words he handed him his largest wine-cup. The old man thanked him very humbly: \\\\\\\"I did not expect such kindness from your lordship. I fear I have only disturbed your pleasant party by my unskillful dancing.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"No, no,\\\\\\\"\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"answered the big demon. \\\\\\\"You must come often and dance for us. Your skill has given us much pleasure.\\\\\\\" The old man thanked him again and promised to do so. \\\\\\\"Then will you come again to-morrow, old man?\\\\\\\" asked the demon. \\\\\\\"Certainly, I will,\\\\\\\"\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"answered the old man. \\\\\\\"Then you must leave some pledge of your word with us,\\\\\\\" said the demon. \\\\\\\"Whatever you like,\\\\\\\" said the old man. \\\\\\\"Now what is the best thing he can leave with us as a pledge?\\\\\\\" asked the demon, looking round. Then said one of the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"demon's attendants kneeling behind the chief: \\\\\\\"The token he leaves with us must be the most important thing to him in his possession. I see the old man has a wen on his right cheek. Now mortal men consider such a wen very fortunate. Let my lord take the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"lump from the old man's right cheek, and he will surely come to-morrow, if only to get that back.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"You are very clever,\\\\\\\" said the demon chief, giving his horns an approving nod. Then he stretched out a hairy arm and claw-like hand, and took the great\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"lump from the old man's right cheek. Strange to say, it came off as easily as a ripe plum from the tree at the demon's touch, and then the merry troop of demons suddenly vanished. The old man was lost in bewilderment by all that had\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"happened. He hardly knew for some time where he was. When he came to understand what had happened to him, he was delighted to find that the lump on his face, which had for so many years disfigured him, had really been taken away without any\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"pain to himself. He put up his hand to feel if any scar remained, but found that his right cheek was as smooth as his left. The sun had long set, and the young moon had risen like a silver crescent in the sky. The old man suddenly realized how late it\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"was and began to hurry home. He patted his right cheek all the time, as if to make sure of his good fortune in having lost the wen. He was so happy that he found it impossible to walk quietly--he ran and danced the whole way home. He found his wife\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"very anxious, wondering what had happened to make him so late. He soon told her all that had passed since he left home that afternoon. She was quite as happy as her husband when he showed her that the ugly lump had disappeared from\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"his face, for in her youth she had prided herself on his good looks, and it had been a daily grief to her to see the horrid growth. Now next door to this good old couple there lived a wicked and disagreeable old man. He, too, had for many years been\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"troubled with the growth of a wen on his left cheek, and he, too, had tried all manner of things to get rid of it, but in vain. He heard at once, through the servant, of his neighbor's good luck in losing the lump on his face, so he called that very\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"evening and asked his friend to tell him everything that concerned the loss of it. The good old man told his disagreeable neighbor all that had happened to him. He described the place where he would find the hollow tree in which to hide, and advised him\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"to be on the spot in the late afternoon towards the time of sunset. The old neighbor started out the very next afternoon, and after hunting about for some time, came to the hollow tree just as his friend had described. Here he hid himself and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"waited for the twilight. Just as he had been told, the band of demons came at that hour and held a feast with dance and song. When this had gone on for some time the chief of the demons looked around and said: \\\\\\\"It is now time for the old man to come as\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"he promised us. Why doesn't he come?\\\\\\\" When the second old man heard these words he ran out of his hiding-place in the tree and, kneeling down before the Oni, said: \\\\\\\"I have been waiting for a long time for you to speak!\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Ah, you are the old man of\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"yesterday,\\\\\\\" said the demon chief. \\\\\\\"Thank you for coming, you must dance for us soon.\\\\\\\" The old man now stood up and opened his fan and began to dance. But he had never learned to dance, and knew nothing about the necessary gestures and different\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"positions. He thought that anything would please the demons, so he just hopped about, waving his arms and stamping his feet, imitating as well as he could any dancing he had ever seen. The Oni were very dissatisfied at this exhibition, and said amongst\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"themselves: \\\\\\\"How badly he dances to-day!\\\\\\\" Then to the old man the demon chief said: \\\\\\\"Your performance to-day is quite different from the dance of yesterday. We don't wish to see any more of such dancing. We will give you back the pledge you left\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"with us. You must go away at once.\\\\\\\" With these words he took out from a fold of his dress the lump which he had taken from the face of the old man who had danced so well the day before, and threw it at the right cheek of the old man who stood before\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"him. The lump immediately attached itself to his cheek as firmly as if it had grown there always, and all attempts to pull it off were useless. The wicked old man, instead of losing the lump on his left cheek as he had hoped, found to his dismay that he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"had but added another to his right cheek in his attempt to get rid of the first. He put up first one hand and then the other to each side of his face to make sure if he were not dreaming a horrible nightmare. No, sure enough there was now a great wen on\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the right side of his face as on the left. The demons had all disappeared, and there was nothing for him to do but to return home. He was a pitiful sight, for his face, with the two large lumps, one on each side, looked just like a Japanese gourd.\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

One day he sallied forth in search\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"of adventures, for he had the nature of a warrior and could not bear to be idle. So he buckled on his two swords, took his huge bow, much taller than himself, in his hand, and slinging his quiver on his back started out. He had not gone far when he came\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"to the bridge of Seta-no-Karashi spanning one end of the beautiful Lake Biwa. No sooner had he set foot on the bridge than he saw lying right across his path a huge serpent-dragon.

One of its huge claws rested on the parapet of one side of the bridge, while its tail lay right against the other. The monster seemed to be asleep, and as it breathed, fire and smoke came out of\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"its nostrils. At first Hidesato could not help feeling alarmed at the sight of this horrible reptile lying in his path, for he must either turn back or walk right over its body. He was a brave man, however, and putting aside all fear went forward\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"dauntlessly. Crunch, crunch! he stepped now on the dragon's body, now between its coils, and without even one glance backward he went on his way. He had only gone a few steps when he heard some one calling him from behind. On turning back he was much\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"surprised to see that the monster dragon had entirely disappeared and in its place was a strange-looking man, who was bowing most ceremoniously to the ground. His red hair streamed over his shoulders and was surmounted by a crown in the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"shape of a dragon's head, and his sea-green dress was patterned with shells. Hidesato knew at once that this was no ordinary mortal and he wondered much at the strange occurrence. Where had the dragon gone in such a short space of time? Or had it\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"transformed itself into this man, and what did the whole thing mean? While these thoughts passed through his mind he had come up to the man on the bridge and now addressed him: \\\\\\\"Was it you that called me just now?\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Yes, it was I,\\\\\\\" answered the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"man: \\\\\\\"I have an earnest request to make to you. Do you think you can grant it to me?\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"If it is in my power to do so I will,\\\\\\\" answered Hidesato, \\\\\\\"but first tell me who you are?\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"I am the Dragon King of the Lake, and my home is in these waters just\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"under this bridge.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"And what is it you have to ask of me!\\\\\\\" said Hidesato. \\\\\\\"I want you to kill my mortal enemy the centipede, who lives on the mountain beyond,\\\\\\\" and the Dragon King pointed to a high peak on the opposite shore of the lake. \\\\\\\"I have lived\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"now for many years in this lake and I have a large family of children and grand-children. For some time past we have lived in terror, for a monster centipede has discovered our home, and night after night it comes and carries off one\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"of my family. I am powerless to save them. If it goes on much longer like this, not only shall I lose all my children, but I myself must fall a victim to the monster. I am, therefore, very unhappy, and in my extremity I determined to ask the help of a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"human being. For many days with this intention I have waited on the bridge in the shape of the horrible serpent-dragon that you saw, in the hope that some strong brave man would come along. But all who came this way, as soon as they\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"saw me were terrified and ran away as fast as they could. You are the first man I have found able to look at me without fear, so I knew at once that you were a man of great courage. I beg you to have pity upon me. Will you not help me and kill my enemy\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the centipede?\\\\\\\" Hidesato felt very sorry for the Dragon King on hearing his story, and readily promised to do what he could to help him. The warrior asked where the centipede lived, so that he might attack the creature at once. The Dragon King replied\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"that its home was on the mountain Mikami, but that as it came every night at a certain hour to the palace of the lake, it would be better to wait till then. So Hidesato was conducted to the palace of the Dragon King, under the bridge. Strange to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"say, as he followed his host downwards the waters parted to let them pass, and his clothes did not even feel damp as he passed through the flood. Never had Hidesato seen anything so beautiful as this palace built of white marble beneath the lake. He\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"had often heard of the Sea King's palace at the bottom of the sea, where all the servants and retainers were salt-water fishes, but here was a magnificent building in the heart of Lake Biwa. The dainty goldfishes, red carp, and silvery\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"trout, waited upon the Dragon King and his guest. Hidesato was astonished at the feast that was spread for him. The dishes were crystallized lotus leaves and flowers, and the chopsticks were of the rarest ebony. As soon as they sat down, the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"sliding doors opened and ten lovely goldfish dancers came out, and behind them followed ten red-carp musicians with the koto and the samisen. Thus the hours flew by till midnight, and the beautiful music and dancing had banished all thoughts of the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"centipede. The Dragon King was about to pledge the warrior in a fresh cup of wine when the palace was suddenly shaken by a tramp, tramp! as if a mighty army had begun to march not far away. Hidesato and his host both rose to their feet and rushed\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"to the balcony, and the warrior saw on the opposite mountain two great balls of glowing fire coming nearer and nearer. The Dragon King stood by the warrior's side trembling with fear. \\\\\\\"The centipede! The centipede! Those two balls of fire are\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"its eyes. It is coming for its prey! Now is the time to kill it.\\\\\\\" Hidesato looked where his host pointed, and, in the dim light of the starlit evening, behind the two balls of fire he saw the long body of an enormous centipede winding round the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"mountains, and the light in its hundred feet glowed like so many distant lanterns moving slowly towards the shore. Hidesato showed not the least sign of fear. He tried to calm the Dragon King. \\\\\\\"Don't be afraid. I shall surely kill the centipede. Just\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"bring me my bow and arrows.\\\\\\\" The Dragon King did as he was bid, and the warrior noticed that he had only three arrows left in his quiver. He took the bow, and fitting an arrow to the notch, took careful aim and let fly. The arrow hit the centipede right\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"in the middle of its head, but instead of penetrating, it glanced off harmless and fell to the ground. Nothing daunted, Hidesato took another arrow, fitted it to the notch of the bow and let fly. Again the arrow hit the mark, it struck the centipede\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"right in the middle of its head, only to glance off and fall to the ground. The centipede was invulnerable to weapons! When the Dragon King saw that even this brave warrior's arrows were powerless to kill the centipede, he lost heart and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"began to tremble with fear. The warrior saw that he had now only one arrow left in his quiver, and if this one failed he could not kill the centipede. He looked across the waters. The huge reptile had wound its horrid body seven times round the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"mountain and would soon come down to the lake. Nearer and nearer gleamed fireballs of eyes, and the light of its hundred feet began to throw reflections in the still waters of the lake. Then suddenly the warrior remembered that he had heard that\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"human saliva was deadly to centipedes. But this was no ordinary centipede. This was so monstrous that even to think of such a creature made one creep with horror. Hidesato determined to try his last chance. So taking his last arrow and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"first putting the end of it in his mouth, he fitted the notch to his bow, took careful aim once more and let fly. This time the arrow again hit the centipede right in the middle of its head, but instead of glancing off harmlessly as before, it struck\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"home to the creature's brain. Then with a convulsive shudder the serpentine body stopped moving, and the fiery light of its great eyes and hundred feet darkened to a dull glare like the sunset of a stormy day, and then went out in\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"blackness. A great darkness now overspread the heavens, the thunder rolled and the lightning flashed, and the wind roared in fury, and it seemed as if the world were coming to an end. The Dragon King and his children and retainers all\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"crouched in different parts of the palace, frightened to death, for the building was shaken to its foundation. At last the dreadful night was over. Day dawned beautiful and clear. The centipede was gone from the mountain. Then\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Hidesato called to the Dragon King to come out with him on the balcony, for the centipede was dead and he had nothing more to fear. Then all the inhabitants of the palace came out with joy, and Hidesato pointed to the lake. There lay the body of the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"dead centipede floating on the water, which was dyed red with its blood. The gratitude of the Dragon King knew no bounds. The whole family came and bowed down before the warrior, calling him their preserver and the bravest warrior in all\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Japan. Another feast was prepared, more sumptuous than the first. All kinds of fish, prepared in every imaginable way, raw, stewed, boiled and roasted, served on coral trays and crystal dishes, were put before him, and the wine was the best\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"that Hidesato had ever tasted. To add to the beauty of everything the sun shone brightly, the lake glittered like a liquid diamond, and the palace was a thousand times more beautiful by day than by night. His host tried to persuade the warrior to stay\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"a few days, but Hidesato insisted on going home, saying that he had now finished what he had come to do, and must return. The Dragon King and his family were all very sorry to have him leave so soon, but since he would go they begged him to accept a few\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"small presents (so they said) in token of their gratitude to him for delivering them forever from their horrible enemy the centipede. As the warrior stood in the porch taking leave, a train of fish was suddenly transformed into a retinue of men, all\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"wearing ceremonial robes and dragon's crowns on their heads to show that they were servants of the great Dragon King. The presents that they carried were as follows: First, a large bronze bell. Second, a bag of rice. Third, a roll of silk. Fourth, a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"cooking pot. Fifth, a bell. Hidesato did not want to accept all these presents, but as the Dragon King insisted, he could not well refuse. The Dragon King himself accompanied the warrior as far as the bridge, and then took leave of him with many bows\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and good wishes, leaving the procession of servants to accompany Hidesato to his house with the presents. The warrior's household and servants had been very much concerned when he did not return the night before, but\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"they concluded that he had been kept by the violent storm and had taken shelter. When the servants on the watch for his return caught sight of him they called to every one and the whole household turned out to meet him, wondering much what the retinue\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"of men, bearing presents and banners, that followed him, could mean. As soon as the Dragon King's retainers had put down the presents they vanished, and Hidesato told all that had happened to him. The presents which he had received\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"from the grateful Dragon King were found to be of magic power. The bell only was ordinary, and as Hidesato had no use for it he presented it to the temple near by, where it was hung up, to boom out the hour of day over the surrounding neighborhood.\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"The single bag of rice, however much was taken from it day after day for the meals of the knight and his whole family, never grew less--the supply in the bag was inexhaustible. The roll of silk, too, never grew shorter, though time after time\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"long pieces were cut off to make the warrior a new suit of clothes to go to Court. The cooking pot was wonderful, too. No matter what was put into it, it cooked deliciously whatever was wanted without any firing--truly a very economical\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"saucepan. The fame of Hidesato's fortune spread far and wide, and as there was no need for him to spend money on rice or silk or firing, he became very rich and prosperous, and was henceforth known as My Lord Bag of Rice.\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

The missing victims were never seen again, so it was whispered\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"that the ogre was a horrible cannibal, who not only killed the unhappy victims but ate them also. Now everybody in the town and neighborhood was in great fear, and no one durst venture out after sunset near the Gate of Rashomon. Now at\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"this time there lived in Kyoto a general named Raiko, who had made himself famous for his brave deeds. Some time before this he made the country ring with his name, for he had attacked Oeyama, where a band of ogres lived with their chief, who instead\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"of wine drank the blood of human beings. He had routed them all and cut off the head of the chief monster. This brave warrior was always followed by a band of faithful knights. In this band there were five knights of great valor. One evening as the five\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"knights sat at a feast quaffing SAKE in their rice bowls and eating all kinds of fish, raw, and stewed, and broiled, and toasting each other's healths and exploits, the first knight, Hojo, said to the others: \\\\\\\"Have you all heard the rumor that every\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"evening after sunset there comes an ogre to the Gate of Rashomon, and that he seizes all who pass by?\\\\\\\" The second knight, Watanabe, answered him, saying: \\\\\\\"Do not talk such nonsense! All the ogres were killed by our chief Raiko at Oeyama! It cannot\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"be true, because even if any ogres did escape from that great killing they would not dare to show themselves in this city, for they know that our brave master would at once attack them if he knew that any of them were still alive!\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Then do you\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"disbelieve what I say, and think that I am telling you a falsehood?\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"No, I do not think that you are telling a lie,\\\\\\\" said Watanabe; \\\\\\\"but you have heard some old woman's story which is not worth believing.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Then the best plan is to prove what I say, by\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"going there yourself and finding out yourself whether it is true or not,\\\\\\\" said Hojo. Watanabe, the second knight, could not bear the thought that his companion should believe he was afraid, so he answered quickly: \\\\\\\"Of course, I will go at once and find\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"out for myself!\\\\\\\" So Watanabe at once got ready to go--he buckled on his long sword and put on a coat of armor, and tied on his large helmet. When he was ready to start he said to the others: \\\\\\\"Give me something so that I can prove I have been there!\\\\\\\"\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Then one of the men got a roll of writing paper and his box of Indian ink and brushes, and the four comrades wrote their names on a piece of paper. \\\\\\\"I will take this,\\\\\\\" said Watanabe, \\\\\\\"and put it on the Gate of Rashomon, so to-morrow\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"morning will you all go and look at it? I may be able to catch an ogre or two by then!\\\\\\\" and he mounted his horse and rode off gallantly. It was a very dark night, and there was neither moon nor star to light Watanabe on his way. To make the darkness\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"worse a storm came on, the rain fell heavily and the wind howled like wolves in the mountains. Any ordinary man would have trembled at the thought of going out of doors, but Watanabe was a brave warrior and dauntless, and his honor and word\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"were at stake, so he sped on into the night, while his companions listened to the sound of his horse's hoofs dying away in the distance, then shut the sliding shutters close and gathered round the charcoal fire and wondered what would happen--and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"whether their comrade would encounter one of those horrible Oni. At last Watanabe reached the Gate of Rashomon, but peer as he might through the darkness he could see no sign of an ogre. \\\\\\\"It is just as I thought,\\\\\\\" said Watanabe to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"himself; \\\\\\\"there are certainly no ogres here; it is only an old woman's story. I will stick this paper on the gate so that the others can see I have been here when they come to-morrow, and then I will take my way home and laugh at them all.\\\\\\\" He fastened\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the piece of paper, signed by all his four companions, on the gate, and then turned his horse's head towards home. As he did so he became aware that some one was behind him, and at the same time a voice called out to him to wait. Then his helmet was\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"seized from the back. \\\\\\\"Who are you?\\\\\\\" said Watanabe fearlessly. He then put out his hand and groped around to find out who or what it was that held him by the helmet. As he did so he touched something that felt like an arm--it was covered with hair\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and as big round as the trunk of a tree! Watanabe knew at once that this was the arm of an ogre, so he drew his sword and cut at it fiercely. There was a loud yell of pain, and then the ogre dashed in front of the warrior. Watanabe's eyes grew large\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"with wonder, for he saw that the ogre was taller than the great gate, his eyes were flashing like mirrors in the sunlight, and his huge mouth was wide open, and as the monster breathed, flames of fire shot out of his mouth. The ogre thought to terrify\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"his foe, but Watanabe never flinched. He attacked the ogre with all his strength, and thus they fought face to face for a long time. At last the ogre, finding that he could neither frighten nor beat Watanabe and that he might himself be beaten, took to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"flight. But Watanabe, determined not to let the monster escape, put spurs to his horse and gave chase. But though the knight rode very fast the ogre ran faster, and to his disappointment he found himself unable to overtake the monster, who was\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"gradually lost to sight. Watanabe returned to the gate where the fierce fight had taken place, and got down from his horse. As he did so he stumbled upon something lying on the ground. Stooping to pick it up he found that it was one of the ogre's\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"huge arms which he must have slashed off in the fight. His joy was great at having secured such a prize, for this was the best of all proofs of his adventure with the ogre. So he took it up carefully and carried it home as a trophy of his victory. When\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"he got back, he showed the arm to his comrades, who one and all called him the hero of their band and gave him a great feast. His wonderful deed was soon noised abroad in Kyoto, and people from far and near came to see the ogre's arm. Watanabe now began\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"to grow uneasy as to how he should keep the arm in safety, for he knew that the ogre to whom it belonged was still alive. He felt sure that one day or other, as soon as the ogre got over his scare, he would come to try to get his arm back again.\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Watanabe therefore had a box made of the strongest wood and banded with iron. In this he placed the arm, and then he sealed down the heavy lid, refusing to open it for anyone. He kept the box in his own room and took charge of it himself, never allowing\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"it out of his sight. Now one night he heard some one knocking at the porch, asking for admittance. When the servant went to the door to see who it was, there was only an old woman, very respectable in appearance. On being asked who she was and what was\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"her business, the old woman replied with a smile that she had been nurse to the master of the house when he was a little baby. If the lord of the house were at home she begged to be allowed to see him. The servant left the old woman at the door and went\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"to tell his master that his old nurse had come to see him. Watanabe thought it strange that she should come at that time of night, but at the thought of his old nurse, who had been like a foster-mother to him and whom he had not seen for a long time, a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"very tender feeling sprang up for her in his heart. He ordered the servant to show her in. The old woman was ushered into the room, and after the customary bows and greetings were over, she said: \\\\\\\"Master, the report of your brave fight with the ogre at\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the Gate of Rashomon is so widely known that even your poor old nurse has heard of it. Is it really true, what every one says, that you cut off one of the ogre's arms? If you did, your deed is highly to be praised!\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"I was very disappointed,\\\\\\\" said\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Watanabe, \\\\\\\"that I was not able take the monster captive, which was what I wished to do, instead of only cutting off an arm!\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"I am very proud to think,\\\\\\\" answered the old woman, \\\\\\\"that my master was so brave as to dare to cut off an ogre's arm.\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"There is nothing that can be compared to your courage. Before I die it is the great wish of my life to see this arm,\\\\\\\" she added pleadingly. \\\\\\\"No,\\\\\\\" said Watanabe, \\\\\\\"I am sorry, but I cannot grant your request.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"But why?\\\\\\\" asked the old woman. \\\\\\\"Because,\\\\\\\"\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"replied Watanabe, \\\\\\\"ogres are very revengeful creatures, and if I open the box there is no telling but that the ogre may suddenly appear and carry off his arm. I have had a box made on purpose with a very strong lid, and in this box I keep the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"ogre's arm secure; and I never show it to any one, whatever happens.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Your precaution is very reasonable,\\\\\\\" said the old woman. \\\\\\\"But I am your old nurse, so surely you will not refuse to show ME the arm. I have only just heard of your brave act, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"not being able to wait till the morning I came at once to ask you to show it to me.\\\\\\\" Watanabe was very troubled at the old woman's pleading, but he still persisted in refusing. Then the old woman said: \\\\\\\"Do you suspect me of being a spy sent by the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"ogre?\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"No, of course I do not suspect you of being the ogre's spy, for you are my old nurse,\\\\\\\" answered Watanabe. \\\\\\\"Then you cannot surely refuse to show me the arm any longer.\\\\\\\" entreated the old woman; \\\\\\\"for it is the great wish of my heart to see for\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"once in my life the arm of an ogre!\\\\\\\" Watanabe could not hold out in his refusal any longer, so he gave in at last, saying: \\\\\\\"Then I will show you the ogre's arm, since you so earnestly wish to see it. Come, follow me!\\\\\\\" and he led the way to his own room,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the old woman following. When they were both in the room Watanabe shut the door carefully, and then going towards a big box which stood in a corner of the room, he took off the heavy lid. He then called to the old woman to come near and look in, for he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"never took the arm out of the box. \\\\\\\"What is it like? Let me have a good look at it,\\\\\\\" said the old nurse, with a joyful face. She came nearer and nearer, as if she were afraid, till she stood right against the box. Suddenly she plunged her hand into the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"box and seized the arm, crying with a fearful voice which made the room shake: \\\\\\\"Oh, joy! I have got my arm back again!\\\\\\\" And from an old woman she was suddenly transformed into the towering figure of the frightful ogre! Watanabe sprang back and was\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"unable to move for a moment, so great was his astonishment; but recognizing the ogre who had attacked him at the Gate of Rashomon, he determined with his usual courage to put an end to him this time. He seized his sword, drew it out of its sheath in a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"flash, and tried to cut the ogre down. So quick was Watanabe that the creature had a narrow escape. But the ogre sprang up to the ceiling, and bursting through the roof, disappeared in the mist and clouds. In this way the ogre escaped with his\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"arm. The knight gnashed his teeth with disappointment, but that was all he could do. He waited in patience for another opportunity to dispatch the ogre. But the latter was afraid of Watanabe's great strength and daring, and never troubled Kyoto\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"again. So once more the people of the city were able to go out without fear even at night time, and the brave deeds of Watanabe have never been forgotten!\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

Before he was born his mother had a vision which foretold that her son would be a great man. One summer evening she went out to walk in\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the meadows to seek the cool breezes which blow at the end of the day and to gaze with pleasure at the star-lit heavens above her.

Kotei in time grew to manhood and succeeded his father the Emperor Yuhi. His early reign was greatly troubled by the rebel Shiyu. This rebel wanted to make himself King, and many were the battles which he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"fought to this end. Shiyu was a wicked magician, his head was made of iron, and there was no man that could conquer him. At last Kotei declared war against the rebel and led his army to battle, and the two armies met on a plain called Takuroku. The\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Emperor boldly attacked the enemy, but the magician brought down a dense fog upon the battlefield, and while the royal army were wandering about in confusion, trying to find their way, Shiyu retreated with his troops, laughing at having fooled the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"royal army. No matter however strong and brave the Emperor's soldiers were, the rebel with his magic could always escape in the end. Kotei returned to his Palace, and thought and pondered deeply as to how he should conquer the magician, for he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"was determined not to give up yet.

But this time no soldier minded the fog, not one was confused. Kotei by pointing to the shinansha could find his way\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and directed the army without a single mistake. He closely pursued the rebel army and drove them backward till they came to a big river. This river Kotei and his men found was swollen by the floods and impossible to cross. Shiyu by using his magic art\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"quickly passed over with his army and shut himself up in a fortress on the opposite bank. When Kotei found his march checked he was wild with disappointment, for he had very nearly overtaken the rebel when the river stopped him.

One day he stepped forth from his tent and after walking about for a short time he came to a pond. Here he sat down on the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"bank and was lost in thought. It was autumn. The trees growing along the edge of the water were shedding their leaves, which floated hither and thither on the surface of the pond. By and by, Kotei's attention was attracted to a spider on the brink of\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the water. The little insect was trying to get on to one of the floating leaves near by. It did so at last, and was soon floating over the water to the other side of the pond. This little incident made the clever Emperor think that he might try to make\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"something that could carry himself and his men over the river in the same way that the leaf had carried over the spider. He set to work and persevered till he invented the first boat. When he found that it was a success he set all his men to make more,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and in time there were enough boats for the whole army.

He spent a great deal of time in making inventions\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"which would benefit his people, and he succeeded in many besides the boat and the South Pointing shinansha. He had reigned about a hundred years when one day, as Kotei was looking upwards, the sky became suddenly red, and something came glittering like\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"gold towards the earth. As it came nearer Kotei saw that it was a great Dragon. The Dragon approached and bowed down its head before the Emperor.

Day after day he would go out and sit on the shore and look longingly over the water in the direction of Inaba, and day after day he hoped to find some way of getting across. One day as usual, the hare was standing on the beach, looking\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"towards the mainland across the water, when he saw a great crocodile swimming near the island. \\\\\\\"This is very lucky!\\\\\\\" thought the hare. \\\\\\\"Now I shall be able to get my wish. I will ask the crocodile to carry me across the sea!\\\\\\\" But he was doubtful\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"whether the crocodile would consent to do what wanted. So he thought instead of asking a favor he would try to get what he wanted by a trick. So with a loud voice he called to the crocodile, and said: \\\\\\\"Oh, Mr. Crocodile, isn't it a lovely day?\\\\\\\" The\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"crocodile, who had come out all by itself that day to enjoy the bright sunshine, was just beginning to feel a bit lonely when the hare's cheerful greeting broke the silence. The crocodile swam nearer the shore, very pleased to hear some one speak. \\\\\\\"I\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"wonder who it was that spoke to me just now! Was it you, Mr. Hare? You must be very lonely all by yourself!\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Oh, no, I am not at all lonely,\\\\\\\" said the hare, \\\\\\\"but as it was such a fine day I came out here to enjoy myself. Won't you stop and play with me\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"a little while?\\\\\\\" The crocodile came out of the sea and sat on the shore, and the two played together for some time. Then the hare said: \\\\\\\"Mr. Crocodile, you live in the sea and I live on this island, and we do not often meet, so I know very little about\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"you. Tell me, do you think the number of your company is greater than mine?\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Of course, there are more crocodiles than hares,\\\\\\\" answered the crocodile. \\\\\\\"Can you not see that for yourself? You live on this small island, while I live in the sea, which\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"spreads through all parts of the world, so if I call together all the crocodiles who dwell in the sea you hares will be as nothing compared to us!\\\\\\\" The crocodile was very conceited. The hare, who meant to play a trick on the crocodile, said: \\\\\\\"Do you\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"think it possible for you to call up enough crocodiles to form a line from this island across the sea to Inaba?\\\\\\\" The crocodile thought for a moment and then answered: \\\\\\\"Of course, it is possible.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Then do try,\\\\\\\" said the artful hare, \\\\\\\"and I will\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"count the number from here!\\\\\\\" The crocodile, who was very simple-minded, and who hadn't the least idea that the hare intended to play a trick on him, agreed to do what the hare asked, and said: \\\\\\\"Wait a little while I go back into the sea and call my\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"company together!\\\\\\\" The crocodile plunged into the sea and was gone for some time. The hare, meanwhile, waited patiently on the shore. At last the crocodile appeared, bringing with him a large number of other crocodiles. \\\\\\\"Look, Mr. Hare!\\\\\\\"\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"said the crocodile, \\\\\\\"it is nothing for my friends to form a line between here and Inaba. There are enough crocodiles to stretch from here even as far as China or India. Did you ever see so many crocodiles?\\\\\\\" Then the whole company of crocodiles\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"arranged themselves in the water so as to form a bridge between the Island of Oki and the mainland of Inaba. When the hare saw the bridge of crocodiles, he said: \\\\\\\"How splendid! I did not believe this was possible. Now let me count you all! To do this,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"however, with your permission, I must walk over on your backs to the other side, so please be so good as not to move, or else I shall fall into the sea and be drowned!\\\\\\\" So the hare hopped off the island on to the strange bridge of crocodiles,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"counting as he jumped from one crocodile's back to the other: \\\\\\\"Please keep quite still, or I shall not be able to count. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine--\\\\\\\" Thus the cunning hare walked right across to the mainland of\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Inaba. Not content with getting his wish, he began to jeer at the crocodiles instead of thanking them, and said, as he leapt off the last one's back: \\\\\\\"Oh! you stupid crocodiles, now I have done with you!\\\\\\\" And he was just about to run away as fast as he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"could. But he did not escape so easily, for so soon as the crocodiles understood that this was a trick played upon them by the hare so as to enable him to cross the sea, and that the hare was now laughing at them for their stupidity, they became\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"furiously angry and made up their minds to take revenge. So some of them ran after the hare and caught him. Then they all surrounded the poop little animal and pulled out all his fur. He cried out loudly and entreated them to spare him, but with each\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"tuft of fur they pulled out they said: \\\\\\\"Serve you right!\\\\\\\" When the crocodiles had pulled out the last bit of fur, they threw the poor hare on the beach, and all swam away laughing at what they had done. The hare was now in a pitiful plight, all his\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"beautiful white fur had been pulled out, and his bare little body was quivering with pain and bleeding all over. He could hardly move, and all he could do was to lie on the beach quite helpless and weep over the misfortune that had befallen him.\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Notwithstanding that it was his own fault that had brought all this misery and suffering upon the white hare of Inaba, any one seeing the poor little creature could not help feeling sorry for him in his sad condition, for the crocodiles had been very\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"cruel in their revenge. Just at this time a number of men, who looked like King's sons, happened to pass by, and seeing the hare lying on the beach crying, stopped and asked what was the matter. The hare lifted up his head from between his paws, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"answered them, saying: \\\\\\\"I had a fight with some crocodiles, but I was beaten, and they pulled out all my fur and left me to suffer here--that is why I am crying.\\\\\\\" Now one of these young men had a bad and spiteful disposition. But he feigned kindness,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and said to the hare: \\\\\\\"I feel very sorry for you. If you will only try it, I know of a remedy which will cure your sore body. Go and bathe yourself in the sea, and then come and sit in the wind. This will make your fur grow again, and you will be just\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"as you were before.\\\\\\\" Then all the young men passed on. The hare was very pleased, thinking that he had found a cure. He went and bathed in the sea and then came out and sat where the wind could blow upon him. But as the wind blew and dried him, his skin\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"became drawn and hardened, and the salt increased the pain so much that he rolled on the sand in his agony and cried aloud. Just then another King's son passed by, carrying a great bag on his back. He saw the hare, and stopped and asked why he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"was crying so loudly. But the poor hare, remembering that he had been deceived by one very like the man who now spoke to him, did not answer, but continued to cry. But this man had a kind heart, and looked at the hare very pityingly, and said: \\\\\\\"You\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"poor thing! I see that your fur is all pulled out and that your skin is quite bare. Who can have treated you so cruelly?\\\\\\\" When the hare heard these kind words he felt very grateful to the man, and encouraged by his gentle manner the hare told him all\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"that had befallen him. The little animal hid nothing from his friend, but told him frankly how he had played a trick on the crocodiles and how he had come across the bridge they had made, thinking that he wished to count their number: how he had jeered\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"at them for their stupidity, and then how the crocodiles had revenged themselves on him. Then he went on to say how he had been deceived by a party of men who looked very like his kind friend: and the hare ended his long tale of woe by begging\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the man to give him some medicine that would cure him and make his fur grow again. When the hare had finished his story, the man was full of pity towards him, and said: \\\\\\\"I am very sorry for all you have suffered, but remember, it was only the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"consequence of the deceit you practiced on the crocodiles.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"I know,\\\\\\\" answered the sorrowful hare, \\\\\\\"but I have repented and made up my mind never to use deceit again, so I beg you to show me how I may cure my sore body and make the fur grow again.\\\\\\\"\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"Then I will tell you of a good remedy,\\\\\\\" said the man. \\\\\\\"First go and bathe well in that pond over there and try to wash all the salt from your body. Then pick some of those kaba flowers that are growing near the edge of the water, spread them on the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"ground and roll yourself on them. If you do this the pollen will cause your fur to grow again, and you will be quite well in a little while.\\\\\\\" The hare was very glad to be told what to do, so kindly. He crawled to the pond pointed out to him, bathed well\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"in it, and then picked the kaba flowers growing near the water, and rolled himself on them. To his amazement, even while he was doing this, he saw his nice white fur growing again, the pain ceased, and he felt just as he had done before all his\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"misfortunes. The hare was overjoyed at his quick recovery, and went hopping joyfully towards the young man who had so helped him, and kneeling down at his feet, said: \\\\\\\"I cannot express my thanks for all you have done for me! It is my earnest wish to do\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"something for you in return. Please tell me who you are?\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"I am no King's son as you think me. I am a fairy, and my name is Okuni-nushi-no-Mikoto,\\\\\\\" answered the man, \\\\\\\"and those beings who passed here before me are my brothers. They have heard of a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"beautiful Princess called Yakami who lives in this province of Inaba, and they are on their way to find her and to ask her to marry one of them. But on this expedition I am only an attendant, so I am walking behind them with this great big bag on my\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"back.\\\\\\\" The hare humbled himself before this great fairy Okuni-nushi-no-Mikoto, whom many in that part of the land worshiped as a god. \\\\\\\"Oh, I did not know that you were Okuni-nushi-no-Mikoto. How kind you have been to me! It is\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"impossible to believe that that unkind fellow who sent me to bathe in the sea is one of your brothers. I am quite sure that the Princess, whom your brothers have gone to seek, will refuse to be the bride of any of them, and will prefer you for your\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"goodness of heart. I am quite sure that you will win her heart without intending to do so, and she will ask to be your bride.\\\\\\\" Okuni-nushi-no-Mikoto took no notice of what the hare said, but bidding the little animal goodby, went on his way quickly and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"soon overtook his brothers. He found them just entering the Princess's gate. Just as the hare had said, the Princess could not be persuaded to become the bride of any of the brothers, but when she looked at the kind brother's face she went\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"straight up to him and said: \\\\\\\"To you I give myself,\\\\\\\" and so they were married. This is the end of the story. Okuni-nushi-no-Mikoto is worshiped by the people in some parts of Japan, as a god, and the hare has become famous as \\\\\\\"The White Hare of Inaba.\\\\\\\"\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"But what became of the crocodiles nobody knows.\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

They slept in twelve beds all in one room; and when they went to bed, the doors were shut and locked up; but every morning their shoes were found to be quite worn through as if they had been\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"danced in all night; and yet nobody could find out how it happened, or where they had been. Then the king made it known to all the land, that if any person could discover the secret, and find out where it was that the princesses danced in the night, he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"should have the one he liked best for his wife, and should be king after his death; but whoever tried and did not succeed, after three days and nights, should be put to death. A king's son soon came. He was well entertained, and in the evening was taken\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"to the chamber next to the one where the princesses lay in their twelve beds. There he was to sit and watch where they went to dance; and, in order that nothing might pass without his hearing it, the door of his chamber was left open. But the king's son\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"soon fell asleep; and when he awoke in the morning he found that the princesses had all been dancing, for the soles of their shoes were full of holes. The same thing happened the second and third night: so the king ordered his head to be cut off. After\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"him came several others; but they had all the same luck, and all lost their lives in the same manner. Now it chanced that an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer, passed through the country where this king reigned: and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"as he was travelling through a wood, he met an old woman, who asked him where he was going. 'I hardly know where I am going, or what I had better do,' said the soldier; 'but I think I should like very well to find out where it is that the princesses\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"dance, and then in time I might be a king.' 'Well,' said the old dame, 'that is no very hard task: only take care not to drink any of the wine which one of the princesses will bring to you in the evening; and as soon as she leaves you pretend to be fast\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"asleep.' Then she gave him a cloak, and said, 'As soon as you put that on you will become invisible, and you will then be able to follow the princesses wherever they go.' When the soldier heard all this good counsel, he determined to try\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"his luck: so he went to the king, and said he was willing to undertake the task. He was as well received as the others had been, and the king ordered fine royal robes to be given him; and when the evening came he was led to the outer chamber. Just as\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"he was going to lie down, the eldest of the princesses brought him a cup of wine; but the soldier threw it all away secretly, taking care not to drink a drop. Then he laid himself down on his bed, and in a little while began to snore very loud as if he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"was fast asleep. When the twelve princesses heard this they laughed heartily; and the eldest said, 'This fellow too might have done a wiser thing than lose his life in this way!' Then they rose up and opened their drawers and boxes, and took\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"out all their fine clothes, and dressed themselves at the glass, and skipped about as if they were eager to begin dancing. But the youngest said, 'I don't know how it is, while you are so happy I feel very uneasy; I am sure some mischance\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"will befall us.' 'You simpleton,' said the eldest, 'you are always afraid; have you forgotten how many kings' sons have already watched in vain? And as for this soldier, even if I had not given him his sleeping draught, he would have slept soundly\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"enough.' When they were all ready, they went and looked at the soldier; but he snored on, and did not stir hand or foot: so they thought they were quite safe; and the eldest went up to her own bed and clapped her hands, and the bed sank into the floor\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and a trap-door flew open. The soldier saw them going down through the trap-door one after another, the eldest leading the way; and thinking he had no time to lose, he jumped up, put on the cloak which the old woman had given him, and followed them; but\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"in the middle of the stairs he trod on the gown of the youngest princess, and she cried out to her sisters, 'All is not right; someone took hold of my gown.' 'You silly creature!' said the eldest, 'it is nothing but a nail in the wall.' Then down they\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"all went, and at the bottom they found themselves in a most delightful grove of trees; and the leaves were all of silver, and glittered and sparkled beautifully. The soldier wished to take away some token of the place; so he broke off a little branch,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and there came a loud noise from the tree. Then the youngest daughter said again, 'I am sure all is not right--did not you hear that noise? That never happened before.' But the eldest said, 'It is only our princes, who are shouting for joy at our\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"approach.' Then they came to another grove of trees, where all the leaves were of gold; and afterwards to a third, where the leaves were all glittering diamonds. And the soldier broke a branch from each; and every time there was a loud noise,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"which made the youngest sister tremble with fear; but the eldest still said, it was only the princes, who were crying for joy. So they went on till they came to a great lake; and at the side of the lake there lay twelve little boats with twelve\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"handsome princes in them, who seemed to be waiting there for the princesses. One of the princesses went into each boat, and the soldier stepped into the same boat with the youngest. As they were rowing over the lake, the prince who was in the boat\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"with the youngest princess and the soldier said, 'I do not know why it is, but though I am rowing with all my might we do not get on so fast as usual, and I am quite tired: the boat seems very heavy today.' 'It is only the heat of the weather,' said\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the princess: 'I feel it very warm too.' On the other side of the lake stood a fine illuminated castle, from which came the merry music of horns and trumpets. There they all landed, and went into the castle, and each prince danced with his princess; and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the soldier, who was all the time invisible, danced with them too; and when any of the princesses had a cup of wine set by her, he drank it all up, so that when she put the cup to her mouth it was empty. At this, too, the youngest sister was terribly\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"frightened, but the eldest always silenced her. They danced on till three o'clock in the morning, and then all their shoes were worn out, so that they were obliged to leave off. The princes rowed them back again over the lake (but this time the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"soldier placed himself in the boat with the eldest princess); and on the opposite shore they took leave of each other, the princesses promising to come again the next night. When they came to the stairs, the soldier ran on before the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"princesses, and laid himself down; and as the twelve sisters slowly came up very much tired, they heard him snoring in his bed; so they said, 'Now all is quite safe'; then they undressed themselves, put away their fine clothes, pulled off their shoes,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and went to bed. In the morning the soldier said nothing about what had happened, but determined to see more of this strange adventure, and went again the second and third night; and every thing happened just as before; the princesses danced each time\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"till their shoes were worn to pieces, and then returned home. However, on the third night the soldier carried away one of the golden cups as a token of where he had been. As soon as the time came when he was to declare the secret, he was taken before\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the king with the three branches and the golden cup; and the twelve princesses stood listening behind the door to hear what he would say. And when the king asked him. 'Where do my twelve daughters dance at night?' he answered, 'With twelve princes in a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"castle under ground.' And then he told the king all that had happened, and showed him the three branches and the golden cup which he had brought with him. Then the king called for the princesses, and asked them whether what the soldier said was\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"true: and when they saw that they were discovered, and that it was of no use to deny what had happened, they confessed it all. And the king asked the soldier which of them he would choose for his wife; and he answered, 'I am not very young, so I\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"will have the eldest.'--And they were married that very day, and the soldier was chosen to be the king's heir.\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

The king said to him: 'You may return to your\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"home, I need you no longer, and you will not receive any more money, for he only receives wages who renders me service for them.' Then the soldier did not know how to earn a living, went away greatly troubled, and walked the whole day, until in the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"evening he entered a forest. When darkness came on, he saw a light, which he went up to, and came to a house wherein lived a witch. 'Do give me one night's lodging, and a little to eat and drink,' said he to her, 'or I shall starve.' 'Oho!' she\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"answered, 'who gives anything to a run-away soldier? Yet will I be compassionate, and take you in, if you will do what I wish.' 'What do you wish?' said the soldier. 'That you should dig all round my garden for me, tomorrow.' The soldier\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"consented, and next day laboured with all his strength, but could not finish it by the evening. 'I see well enough,' said the witch, 'that you can do no more today, but I will keep you yet another night, in payment for which you must tomorrow chop me a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"load of wood, and chop it small.' The soldier spent the whole day in doing it, and in the evening the witch proposed that he should stay one night more. 'Tomorrow, you shall only do me a very trifling piece of work. Behind my house, there is an\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"old dry well, into which my light has fallen, it burns blue, and never goes out, and you shall bring it up again.' Next day the old woman took him to the well, and let him down in a basket. He found the blue light, and made her a signal to draw him up\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"again. She did draw him up, but when he came near the edge, she stretched down her hand and wanted to take the blue light away from him. 'No,' said he, perceiving her evil intention, 'I will not give you the light until I am standing with both feet upon\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the ground.' The witch fell into a passion, let him fall again into the well, and went away. The poor soldier fell without injury on the moist ground, and the blue light went on burning, but of what use was that to him? He saw very well that he could\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"not escape death. He sat for a while very sorrowfully, then suddenly he felt in his pocket and found his tobacco pipe, which was still half full. 'This shall be my last pleasure,' thought he, pulled it out, lit it at the blue light and began to smoke.\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"When the smoke had circled about the cavern, suddenly a little black dwarf stood before him, and said: 'Lord, what are your commands?' 'What my commands are?' replied the soldier, quite astonished. 'I must do everything you bid me,' said the little\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"man. 'Good,' said the soldier; 'then in the first place help me out of this well.' The little man took him by the hand, and led him through an underground passage, but he did not forget to take the blue light with him. On the way the dwarf showed him\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the treasures which the witch had collected and hidden there, and the soldier took as much gold as he could carry. When he was above, he said to the little man: 'Now go and bind the old witch, and carry her before the judge.' In a short time she came by\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"like the wind, riding on a wild tom-cat and screaming frightfully. Nor was it long before the little man reappeared. 'It is all done,' said he, 'and the witch is already hanging on the gallows. What further commands has my lord?' inquired the dwarf. 'At\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"this moment, none,' answered the soldier; 'you can return home, only be at hand immediately, if I summon you.' 'Nothing more is needed than that you should light your pipe at the blue light, and I will appear before you at once.' Thereupon he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"vanished from his sight. The soldier returned to the town from which he came. He went to the best inn, ordered himself handsome clothes, and then bade the landlord furnish him a room as handsome as possible. When it was ready and the soldier had taken\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"possession of it, he summoned the little black manikin and said: 'I have served the king faithfully, but he has dismissed me, and left me to hunger, and now I want to take my revenge.' 'What am I to do?' asked the little man. 'Late at night, when the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"king's daughter is in bed, bring her here in her sleep, she shall do servant's work for me.' The manikin said: 'That is an easy thing for me to do, but a very dangerous thing for you, for if it is discovered, you will fare ill.' When twelve o'clock had\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"struck, the door sprang open, and the manikin carried in the princess. 'Aha! are you there?' cried the soldier, 'get to your work at once! Fetch the broom and sweep the chamber.' When she had done this, he ordered her to come to his chair, and then he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"stretched out his feet and said: 'Pull off my boots,' and then he threw them in her face, and made her pick them up again, and clean and brighten them. She, however, did everything he bade her, without opposition, silently and with\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"half-shut eyes. When the first cock crowed, the manikin carried her back to the royal palace, and laid her in her bed. Next morning when the princess arose she went to her father, and told him that she had had a very strange dream. 'I was carried\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"through the streets with the rapidity of lightning,' said she, 'and taken into a soldier's room, and I had to wait upon him like a servant, sweep his room, clean his boots, and do all kinds of menial work. It was only a dream, and yet I am just as tired\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"as if I really had done everything.' 'The dream may have been true,' said the king. 'I will give you a piece of advice. Fill your pocket full of peas, and make a small hole in the pocket, and then if you are carried away again, they will fall out and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"leave a track in the streets.' But unseen by the king, the manikin was standing beside him when he said that, and heard all. At night when the sleeping princess was again carried through the streets, some peas certainly did fall out of her pocket, but\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"they made no track, for the crafty manikin had just before scattered peas in every street there was. And again the princess was compelled to do servant's work until cock-crow. Next morning the king sent his people out to seek the track, but it\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"was all in vain, for in every street poor children were sitting, picking up peas, and saying: 'It must have rained peas, last night.' 'We must think of something else,' said the king; 'keep your shoes on when you go to bed, and before you come back\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"from the place where you are taken, hide one of them there, I will soon contrive to find it.' The black manikin heard this plot, and at night when the soldier again ordered him to bring the princess, revealed it to him, and told him that he knew of no\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"expedient to counteract this stratagem, and that if the shoe were found in the soldier's house it would go badly with him. 'Do what I bid you,' replied the soldier, and again this third night the princess was obliged to work like a servant, but\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"before she went away, she hid her shoe under the bed. Next morning the king had the entire town searched for his daughter's shoe. It was found at the soldier's, and the soldier himself, who at the entreaty of the dwarf had gone outside the gate,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"was soon brought back, and thrown into prison. In his flight he had forgotten the most valuable things he had, the blue light and the gold, and had only one ducat in his pocket. And now loaded with chains, he was standing at the window of his dungeon,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"when he chanced to see one of his comrades passing by. The soldier tapped at the pane of glass, and when this man came up, said to him: 'Be so kind as to fetch me the small bundle I have left lying in the inn, and I will give you a ducat for doing it.'\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"His comrade ran thither and brought him what he wanted. As soon as the soldier was alone again, he lighted his pipe and summoned the black manikin. 'Have no fear,' said the latter to his master. 'Go wheresoever they take you, and let them do what they\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"will, only take the blue light with you.' Next day the soldier was tried, and though he had done nothing wicked, the judge condemned him to death. When he was led forth to die, he begged a last favour of the king. 'What is it?' asked the king. 'That I\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"may smoke one more pipe on my way.' 'You may smoke three,' answered the king, 'but do not imagine that I will spare your life.' Then the soldier pulled out his pipe and lighted it at the blue light, and as soon as a few wreaths of smoke had ascended,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the manikin was there with a small cudgel in his hand, and said: 'What does my lord command?' 'Strike down to earth that false judge there, and his constable, and spare not the king who has treated me so ill.' Then the manikin fell on them like\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"lightning, darting this way and that way, and whosoever was so much as touched by his cudgel fell to earth, and did not venture to stir again. The king was terrified; he threw himself on the soldier's mercy, and merely to be allowed to live at all, gave\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"him his kingdom for his own, and his daughter to wife.\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

But one day as the queen was walking by the side of the river, at the bottom of the garden, she saw a poor little fish,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"that had thrown itself out of the water, and lay gasping and nearly dead on the bank. Then the queen took pity on the little fish, and threw it back again into the river; and before it swam away it lifted its head out of the water and said, 'I know\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"what your wish is, and it shall be fulfilled, in return for your kindness to me--you will soon have a daughter.' What the little fish had foretold soon came to pass; and the queen had a little girl, so very beautiful that the king could not cease\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"looking on it for joy, and said he would hold a great feast and make merry, and show the child to all the land. So he asked his kinsmen, and nobles, and friends, and neighbours.

Now there were thirteen fairies in the kingdom; but as the king and queen had only twelve golden dishes for them to eat out of, they were forced to leave one of the fairies without asking her. So twelve fairies came,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"each with a high red cap on her head, and red shoes with high heels on her feet, and a long white wand in her hand: and after the feast was over they gathered round in a ring and gave all their best gifts to the little princess. One gave her goodness,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"another beauty, another riches, and so on till she had all that was good in the world. Just as eleven of them had done blessing her, a great noise was heard in the courtyard, and word was brought that the thirteenth fairy was come, with a black cap on\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"her head, and black shoes on her feet, and a broomstick in her hand: and presently up she came into the dining-hall. Now, as she had not been asked to the feast she was very angry, and scolded the king and queen very much, and set to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"work to take her revenge. So she cried out, 'The king's daughter shall, in her fifteenth year, be wounded by a spindle, and fall down dead.' Then the twelfth of the friendly fairies, who had not yet given her gift, came forward, and said that the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"evil wish must be fulfilled, but that she could soften its mischief; so her gift was, that the king's daughter, when the spindle wounded her, should not really die, but should only fall asleep for a hundred years. However, the king hoped still to save\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"his dear child altogether from the threatened evil; so he ordered that all the spindles in the kingdom should be bought up and burnt. But all the gifts of the first eleven fairies were in the meantime fulfilled; for the princess was so beautiful, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"well behaved, and good, and wise, that everyone who knew her loved her. It happened that, on the very day she was fifteen years old, the king and queen were not at home, and she was left alone in the palace. So she roved about by herself, and looked at\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"all the rooms and chambers, till at last she came to an old tower, to which there was a narrow staircase ending with a little door. In the door there was a golden key, and when she turned it the door sprang open, and there sat an old lady spinning away\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"very busily. 'Why, how now, good mother,' said the princess; 'what are you doing there?' 'Spinning,' said the old lady, and nodded her head, humming a tune, while buzz! went the wheel. 'How prettily that little thing turns round!' said the princess, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"took the spindle and began to try and spin. But scarcely had she touched it, before the fairy's prophecy was fulfilled; the spindle wounded her, and she fell down lifeless on the ground. However, she was not dead, but had only fallen into a deep\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"sleep; and the king and the queen, who had just come home, and all their court, fell asleep too; and the horses slept in the stables, and the dogs in the court, the pigeons on the house-top, and the very flies slept upon the walls. Even the fire on the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"hearth left off blazing, and went to sleep; the jack stopped, and the spit that was turning about with a goose upon it for the king's dinner stood still; and the cook, who was at that moment pulling the kitchen-boy by the hair to give him a box on the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"ear for something he had done amiss, let him go, and both fell asleep; the butler, who was slyly tasting the ale, fell asleep with the jug at his lips: and thus everything stood still, and slept soundly. A large hedge of thorns soon grew round the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"palace, and every year it became higher and thicker; till at last the old palace was surrounded and hidden, so that not even the roof or the chimneys could be seen. But there went a report through all the land of the beautiful sleeping Briar Rose (for\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"so the king's daughter was called): so that, from time to time, several kings' sons came, and tried to break through the thicket into the palace. This, however, none of them could ever do; for the thorns and bushes laid hold of them, as it were\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"with hands; and there they stuck fast, and died wretchedly. After many, many years there came a king's son into that land: and an old man told him the story of the thicket of thorns; and how a beautiful palace stood behind it, and how a wonderful\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"princess, called Briar Rose, lay in it asleep, with all her court. He told, too, how he had heard from his grandfather that many, many princes had come, and had tried to break through the thicket, but that they had all stuck fast in it, and died. Then\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the young prince said, 'All this shall not frighten me; I will go and see this Briar Rose.' The old man tried to hinder him, but he was bent upon going. Now that very day the hundred years were ended; and as the prince came to the thicket he saw nothing\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"but beautiful flowering shrubs, through which he went with ease, and they shut in after him as thick as ever. Then he came at last to the palace, and there in the court lay the dogs asleep; and the horses were standing in the stables; and on\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the roof sat the pigeons fast asleep, with their heads under their wings.

She looked so beautiful that he could not take his eyes off her, so he stooped down and gave her a kiss.\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"But the moment he kissed her she opened her eyes and awoke, and smiled upon him; and they went out together; and soon the king and queen also awoke, and all the court, and gazed on each other with great wonder.

'But we must make a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"provision for winter, or else we shall suffer from hunger,' said the cat; 'and you, little mouse, cannot venture everywhere, or you will be caught in a trap some day.' The good advice was followed, and a pot of fat was bought, but they did not know\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"where to put it. At length, after much consideration, the cat said: 'I know no place where it will be better stored up than in the church, for no one dares take anything away from there. We will set it beneath the altar, and not touch it until we are\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"really in need of it.' So the pot was placed in safety, but it was not long before the cat had a great yearning for it, and said to the mouse: 'I want to tell you something, little mouse; my cousin has brought a little son into the world, and has asked\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"me to be godmother; he is white with brown spots, and I am to hold him over the font at the christening. Let me go out today, and you look after the house by yourself.' 'Yes, yes,' answered the mouse, 'by all means go, and if you get anything very good\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"to eat, think of me. I should like a drop of sweet red christening wine myself.' All this, however, was untrue; the cat had no cousin, and had not been asked to be godmother. She went straight to the church, stole to the pot of fat, began\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"to lick at it, and licked the top of the fat off. Then she took a walk upon the roofs of the town, looked out for opportunities, and then stretched herself in the sun, and licked her lips whenever she thought of the pot of fat, and not until it\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"was evening did she return home. 'Well, here you are again,' said the mouse, 'no doubt you have had a merry day.' 'All went off well,' answered the cat. 'What name did they give the child?' 'Top off!' said the cat quite coolly. 'Top off!' cried the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"mouse, 'that is a very odd and uncommon name, is it a usual one in your family?' 'What does that matter,' said the cat, 'it is no worse than Crumb-stealer, as your godchildren are called.' Before long the cat was seized by another fit of yearning. She\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"said to the mouse: 'You must do me a favour, and once more manage the house for a day alone. I am again asked to be godmother, and, as the child has a white ring round its neck, I cannot refuse.' The good mouse consented, but the cat crept behind\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the town walls to the church, and devoured half the pot of fat. 'Nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps to oneself,' said she, and was quite satisfied with her day's work. When she went home the mouse inquired: 'And what was the child\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"christened?' 'Half-done,' answered the cat. 'Half-done! What are you saying? I never heard the name in my life, I'll wager anything it is not in the calendar!' The cat's mouth soon began to water for some more licking. 'All good things go in\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"threes,' said she, 'I am asked to stand godmother again. The child is quite black, only it has white paws, but with that exception, it has not a single white hair on its whole body; this only happens once every few years, you will let me go, won't\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"you?' 'Top-off! Half-done!' answered the mouse, 'they are such odd names, they make me very thoughtful.' 'You sit at home,' said the cat, 'in your dark-grey fur coat and long tail, and are filled with fancies, that's because you do not go out in the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"daytime.' During the cat's absence the mouse cleaned the house, and put it in order, but the greedy cat entirely emptied the pot of fat. 'When everything is eaten up one has some peace,' said she to herself, and well filled and fat she did not return\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"home till night. The mouse at once asked what name had been given to the third child. 'It will not please you more than the others,' said the cat. 'He is called All-gone.' 'All-gone,' cried the mouse 'that is the most suspicious name of all! I have\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"never seen it in print. All-gone; what can that mean?' and she shook her head, curled herself up, and lay down to sleep. From this time forth no one invited the cat to be godmother, but when the winter had come and there was no longer anything to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"be found outside, the mouse thought of their provision, and said: 'Come, cat, we will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves--we shall enjoy that.' 'Yes,' answered the cat, 'you will enjoy it as much as you would enjoy sticking\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"that dainty tongue of yours out of the window.' They set out on their way, but when they arrived, the pot of fat certainly was still in its place, but it was empty. 'Alas!' said the mouse, 'now I see what has happened, now it comes to light! You a true\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"friend! You have devoured all when you were standing godmother. First top off, then half-done, then--' 'Will you hold your tongue,' cried the cat, 'one word more, and I will eat you too.' 'All-gone' was already on the poor mouse's lips; scarcely had she\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"spoken it before the cat sprang on her, seized her, and swallowed her down. Verily, that is the way of the world.\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

So the messengers came home, and had had all their trouble for nothing. Now the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"king had a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same golden hair.

When the courtiers heard this they were shocked, and said, 'Heaven forbid that a father should marry his\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"daughter! Out of so great a sin no good can come.' And his daughter was also shocked, but hoped the king would soon give up such thoughts; so she said to him, 'Before I marry anyone I must have three dresses: one must be of gold, like the sun; another\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"must be of shining silver, like the moon; and a third must be dazzling as the stars: besides this, I want a mantle of a thousand different kinds of fur put together, to which every beast in the kingdom must give a part of his skin.' And thus she though\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"he would think of the matter no more. But the king made the most skilful workmen in his kingdom weave the three dresses: one golden, like the sun; another silvery, like the moon; and a third sparkling, like the stars: and his hunters were told to hunt\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"out all the beasts in his kingdom, and to take the finest fur out of their skins: and thus a mantle of a thousand furs was made. When all were ready, the king sent them to her; but she got up in the night when all were asleep, and took three of her\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"trinkets, a golden ring, a golden necklace, and a golden brooch, and packed the three dresses--of the sun, the moon, and the stars--up in a nutshell, and wrapped herself up in the mantle made of all sorts of fur, and besmeared her\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"face and hands with soot. Then she threw herself upon Heaven for help in her need, and went away, and journeyed on the whole night, till at last she came to a large wood. As she was very tired, she sat herself down in the hollow of a tree and soon fell\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"asleep: and there she slept on till it was midday. Now as the king to whom the wood belonged was hunting in it, his dogs came to the tree, and began to snuff about, and run round and round, and bark. 'Look sharp!' said the king to the huntsmen, 'and see\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"what sort of game lies there.' And the huntsmen went up to the tree, and when they came back again said, 'In the hollow tree there lies a most wonderful beast, such as we never saw before; its skin seems to be of a thousand kinds of fur, but there it\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"lies fast asleep.' 'See,' said the king, 'if you can catch it alive, and we will take it with us.' So the huntsmen took it up, and the maiden awoke and was greatly frightened, and said, 'I am a poor child that has neither father nor mother left; have\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"pity on me and take me with you.' Then they said, 'Yes, Miss Cat-skin, you will do for the kitchen; you can sweep up the ashes, and do things of that sort.' So they put her into the coach, and took her home to the king's palace. Then they showed her a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"little corner under the staircase, where no light of day ever peeped in, and said, 'Cat-skin, you may lie and sleep there.' And she was sent into the kitchen, and made to fetch wood and water, to blow the fire, pluck the poultry, pick the herbs, sift\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the ashes, and do all the dirty work. Thus Cat-skin lived for a long time very sorrowfully. 'Ah! pretty princess!' thought she, 'what will now become of thee?' But it happened one day that a feast was to be held in the king's castle, so she said to the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"cook, 'May I go up a little while and see what is going on? I will take care and stand behind the door.' And the cook said, 'Yes, you may go, but be back again in half an hour's time, to rake out the ashes.' Then she took her little lamp, and went into\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"her cabin, and took off the fur skin, and washed the soot from off her face and hands, so that her beauty shone forth like the sun from behind the clouds. She next opened her nutshell, and brought out of it the dress that shone like the sun, and so\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"went to the feast. Everyone made way for her, for nobody knew her, and they thought she could be no less than a king's daughter. But the king came up to her, and held out his hand and danced with her; and he thought in his heart, 'I never saw any one\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"half so beautiful.' When the dance was at an end she curtsied; and when the king looked round for her, she was gone, no one knew wither. The guards that stood at the castle gate were called in: but they had seen no one. The truth was, that\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"she had run into her little cabin, pulled off her dress, blackened her face and hands, put on the fur-skin cloak, and was Cat-skin again. When she went into the kitchen to her work, and began to rake the ashes, the cook said, 'Let that alone till the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"morning, and heat the king's soup; I should like to run up now and give a peep: but take care you don't let a hair fall into it, or you will run a chance of never eating again.' As soon as the cook went away, Cat-skin heated the king's soup, and toasted\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"a slice of bread first, as nicely as ever she could; and when it was ready, she went and looked in the cabin for her little golden ring, and put it into the dish in which the soup was. When the dance was over, the king ordered his soup to be brought in;\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and it pleased him so well, that he thought he had never tasted any so good before. At the bottom he saw a gold ring lying; and as he could not make out how it had got there, he ordered the cook to be sent for. The cook was frightened when he heard the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"order, and said to Cat-skin, 'You must have let a hair fall into the soup; if it be so, you will have a good beating.' Then he went before the king, and he asked him who had cooked the soup. 'I did,' answered the cook. But the king said, 'That is not\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"true; it was better done than you could do it.' Then he answered, 'To tell the truth I did not cook it, but Cat-skin did.' 'Then let Cat-skin come up,' said the king: and when she came he said to her, 'Who are you?' 'I am a poor child,' said she, 'that\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"has lost both father and mother.' 'How came you in my palace?' asked he. 'I am good for nothing,' said she, 'but to be scullion-girl, and to have boots and shoes thrown at my head.' 'But how did you get the ring that was in the soup?' asked the king.\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Then she would not own that she knew anything about the ring; so the king sent her away again about her business. After a time there was another feast, and Cat-skin asked the cook to let her go up and see it as before. 'Yes,' said he, 'but come again in\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"half an hour, and cook the king the soup that he likes so much.' Then she ran to her little cabin, washed herself quickly, and took her dress out which was silvery as the moon, and put it on; and when she went in, looking like a king's daughter, the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"king went up to her, and rejoiced at seeing her again, and when the dance began he danced with her. After the dance was at an end she managed to slip out, so slyly that the king did not see where she was gone; but she sprang into her little cabin, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"made herself into Cat-skin again, and went into the kitchen to cook the soup. Whilst the cook was above stairs, she got the golden necklace and dropped it into the soup; then it was brought to the king, who ate it, and it pleased him as well as before;\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"so he sent for the cook, who was again forced to tell him that Cat-skin had cooked it. Cat-skin was brought again before the king, but she still told him that she was only fit to have boots and shoes thrown at her head. But when the king had ordered a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"feast to be got ready for the third time, it happened just the same as before. 'You must be a witch, Cat-skin,' said the cook; 'for you always put something into your soup, so that it pleases the king better than mine.' However, he let her go up as\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"before. Then she put on her dress which sparkled like the stars, and went into the ball-room in it; and the king danced with her again, and thought she had never looked so beautiful as she did then. So whilst he was dancing with her, he put a gold ring\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"on her finger without her seeing it, and ordered that the dance should be kept up a long time. When it was at an end, he would have held her fast by the hand, but she slipped away, and sprang so quickly through the crowd that he lost sight of her: and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"she ran as fast as she could into her little cabin under the stairs. But this time she kept away too long, and stayed beyond the half-hour; so she had not time to take off her fine dress, and threw her fur mantle over it, and in her haste did not\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"blacken herself all over with soot, but left one of her fingers white. Then she ran into the kitchen, and cooked the king's soup; and as soon as the cook was gone, she put the golden brooch into the dish. When the king got to the bottom, he ordered\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Cat-skin to be called once more, and soon saw the white finger, and the ring that he had put on it whilst they were dancing: so he seized her hand, and kept fast hold of it, and when she wanted to loose herself and spring away, the fur cloak fell off a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"little on one side, and the starry dress sparkled underneath it. Then he got hold of the fur and tore it off, and her golden hair and beautiful form were seen, and she could no longer hide herself: so she washed the soot and ashes from her face, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"showed herself to be the most beautiful princess upon the face of the earth. But the king said, 'You are my beloved bride, and we will never more be parted from each other.' And the wedding feast was held, and a merry day it was, as ever was\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"heard of or seen in that country, or indeed in any other.\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

The maid went and found her sitting in front of the barrel, screaming loudly. 'Elsie why do you weep?' asked the maid. 'Ah,' she answered, 'have I not reason to weep? If I get Hans, and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to draw\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"beer here, the pick-axe will perhaps fall on his head, and kill him.' Then said the maid: 'What a clever Elsie we have!' and sat down beside her and began loudly to weep over the misfortune.

The boy went down, and there sat Clever Elsie and the girl both weeping together. Then he asked: 'Why are you weeping?'\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"'Ah,' said Elsie, 'have I not reason to weep? If I get Hans, and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to draw beer here, the pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.' Then said the boy: 'What a clever Elsie we have!' and sat down by her, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"likewise began to howl loudly. Upstairs they waited for the boy, but as he still did not return, the man said to the woman: 'Just go down into the cellar and see where Elsie is!' The woman went down, and found all three in the midst of their\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"lamentations, and inquired what was the cause; then Elsie told her also that her future child was to be killed by the pick-axe, when it grew big and had to draw beer, and the pick-axe fell down. Then said the mother likewise: 'What a clever Elsie we\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"have!' and sat down and wept with them. The man upstairs waited a short time, but as his wife did not come back and his thirst grew ever greater, he said: 'I must go into the cellar myself and see where Elsie is.' But when he got into the cellar, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"they were all sitting together crying, and he heard the reason, and that Elsie's child was the cause, and the Elsie might perhaps bring one into the world some day, and that he might be killed by the pick-axe, if he should happen to be sitting beneath\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"it, drawing beer just at the very time when it fell down, he cried: 'Oh, what a clever Elsie!' and sat down, and likewise wept with them. The bridegroom stayed upstairs alone for along time; then as no one would come back he thought: 'They must be\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"waiting for me below: I too must go there and see what they are about.' When he got down, the five of them were sitting screaming and lamenting quite piteously, each out-doing the other. 'What misfortune has happened then?' asked he. 'Ah, dear\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Hans,' said Elsie, 'if we marry each other and have a child, and he is big, and we perhaps send him here to draw something to drink, then the pick-axe which has been left up there might dash his brains out if it were to fall down, so have we not\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"reason to weep?' 'Come,' said Hans, 'more understanding than that is not needed for my household, as you are such a clever Elsie, I will have you,' and seized her hand, took her upstairs with him, and married her. After Hans had had her some time, he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"said: 'Wife, I am going out to work and earn some money for us; go into the field and cut the corn that we may have some bread.' 'Yes, dear Hans, I will do that.' After Hans had gone away, she cooked herself some good broth and took it into the field\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"with her. When she came to the field she said to herself: 'What shall I do; shall I cut first, or shall I eat first? Oh, I will eat first.' Then she drank her cup of broth and when she was fully satisfied, she once more said: 'What shall I do? Shall I\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"cut first, or shall I sleep first? I will sleep first.' Then she lay down among the corn and fell asleep. Hans had been at home for a long time, but Elsie did not come; then said he: 'What a clever Elsie I have; she is so industrious that she does not\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"even come home to eat.' But when evening came and she still stayed away, Hans went out to see what she had cut, but nothing was cut, and she was lying among the corn asleep. Then Hans hastened home and brought a fowler's net with little bells and hung\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"it round about her, and she still went on sleeping. Then he ran home, shut the house-door, and sat down in his chair and worked. At length, when it was quite dark, Clever Elsie awoke and when she got up there was a jingling all round about her, and the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"bells rang at each step which she took. Then she was alarmed, and became uncertain whether she really was Clever Elsie or not, and said: 'Is it I, or is it not I?' But she knew not what answer to make to this, and stood for a time in doubt; at length\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"she thought: 'I will go home and ask if it be I, or if it be not I, they will be sure to know.' She ran to the door of her own house, but it was shut; then she knocked at the window and cried: 'Hans, is Elsie within?' 'Yes,' answered Hans, 'she is\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"within.' Hereupon she was terrified, and said: 'Ah, heavens! Then it is not I,' and went to another door; but when the people heard the jingling of the bells they would not open it, and she could get in nowhere. Then she ran out of the village, and no\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"one has seen her since.\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

And when she came home she drank, in her\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"gladness of heart, a draught of wine, and as wine excites a desire to eat, she tasted the best of whatever she was cooking until she was satisfied, and said: 'The cook must know what the food is like.' It came to pass that the master one day said to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"her: 'Gretel, there is a guest coming this evening; prepare me two fowls very daintily.' 'I will see to it, master,' answered Gretel. She killed two fowls, scalded them, plucked them, put them on the spit, and towards evening set them before the fire,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"that they might roast. The fowls began to turn brown, and were nearly ready, but the guest had not yet arrived. Then Gretel called out to her master: 'If the guest does not come, I must take the fowls away from the fire, but it will be a sin and a shame\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"if they are not eaten the moment they are at their juiciest.' The master said: 'I will run myself, and fetch the guest.' When the master had turned his back, Gretel laid the spit with the fowls on one side, and thought: 'Standing so long by the fire\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"there, makes one sweat and thirsty; who knows when they will come?

She ran down, set a jug, said: 'God bless it for you, Gretel,' and took a good drink, and thought that wine should flow on,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and should not be interrupted, and took yet another hearty draught. Then she went and put the fowls down again to the fire, basted them, and drove the spit merrily round. But as the roast meat smelt so good, Gretel thought: 'Something might be wrong,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"it ought to be tasted!' She touched it with her finger, and said: 'Ah! how good fowls are! It certainly is a sin and a shame that they are not eaten at the right time!'

So she cut it off, ate it, and enjoyed it, and when she had done, she thought: 'The other must go down too, or else master will\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"observe that something is missing.' When the two wings were eaten, she went and looked for her master, and did not see him. It suddenly occurred to her: 'Who knows? They are perhaps not coming at all, and have turned in somewhere.'

When one of the chickens was swallowed down, and still her master did not come, Gretel looked at the other and said: 'What one is, the other should be likewise, the two go together; what's right for the one\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"is right for the other; I think if I were to take another draught it would do me no harm.' So she took another hearty drink, and let the second chicken follow the first.

'Yes, sir, I will soon serve up,' answered Gretel.

Presently the guest came, and knocked politely and courteously at the house-door.

When the money was being counted out to him, it so happened that the doctor was sitting at table, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"when the peasant saw how well he ate and drank, his heart desired what he saw, and would willingly have been a doctor too. So he remained standing a while, and at length inquired if he too could not be a doctor. 'Oh, yes,' said the doctor, 'that is soon\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"managed.' 'What must I do?' asked the peasant. 'In the first place buy yourself an A B C book of the kind which has a cock on the frontispiece; in the second, turn your cart and your two oxen into money, and get yourself some clothes, and whatsoever\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"else pertains to medicine; thirdly, have a sign painted for yourself with the words: \\\\\\\"I am Doctor Knowall,\\\\\\\" and have that nailed up above your house-door.' The peasant did everything that he had been told to do. When he had doctored people\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"awhile, but not long, a rich and great lord had some money stolen. Then he was told about Doctor Knowall who lived in such and such a village, and must know what had become of the money. So the lord had the horses harnessed to his carriage, drove\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"out to the village, and asked Crabb if he were Doctor Knowall. Yes, he was, he said. Then he was to go with him and bring back the stolen money. 'Oh, yes, but Grete, my wife, must go too.' The lord was willing, and let both of them have a seat in the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"carriage, and they all drove away together.

And when\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the first servant came with a dish of delicate fare, the peasant nudged his wife, and said: 'Grete, that was the first,' meaning that was the servant who brought the first dish. The servant, however, thought he intended by that to say: 'That is the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"first thief,' and as he actually was so, he was terrified, and said to his comrade outside: 'The doctor knows all: we shall fare ill, he said I was the first.' The second did not want to go in at all, but was forced. So when he went in with his dish,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the peasant nudged his wife, and said: 'Grete, that is the second.' This servant was equally alarmed, and he got out as fast as he could. The third fared no better, for the peasant again said: 'Grete, that is the third.' The fourth had to carry in a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"dish that was covered, and the lord told the doctor that he was to show his skill, and guess what was beneath the cover. Actually, there were crabs. The doctor looked at the dish, had no idea what to say, and cried: 'Ah, poor Crabb.' When the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"lord heard that, he cried: 'There! he knows it; he must also know who has the money!' On this the servants looked terribly uneasy, and made a sign to the doctor that they wished him to step outside for a moment. When therefore he went out, all four\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"of them confessed to him that they had stolen the money, and said that they would willingly restore it and give him a heavy sum into the bargain, if he would not denounce them, for if he did they would be hanged. They led him to the spot where the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"money was concealed. With this the doctor was satisfied, and returned to the hall, sat down to the table, and said: 'My lord, now will I search in my book where the gold is hidden.' The fifth servant, however, crept into the stove to hear if the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"doctor knew still more. But the doctor sat still and opened his A B C book, turned the pages backwards and forwards, and looked for the cock. As he could not find it immediately he said: 'I know you are there, so you had better come out!' Then the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"fellow in the stove thought that the doctor meant him, and full of terror, sprang out, crying: 'That man knows everything!'

At last he could bear it no longer; so he took to his heels, and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood. On the road he met a sparrow that said to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"him, 'Why are you so sad, my friend?' 'Because,' said the dog, 'I am very very hungry, and have nothing to eat.' 'If that be all,' answered the sparrow, 'come with me into the next town, and I will soon find you plenty of food.' So on they went together\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"into the town: and as they passed by a butcher's shop, the sparrow said to the dog, 'Stand there a little while till I peck you down a piece of meat.' So the sparrow perched upon the shelf: and having first looked carefully about her to see if anyone\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"was watching her, she pecked and scratched at a steak that lay upon the edge of the shelf, till at last down it fell. Then the dog snapped it up, and scrambled away with it into a corner, where he soon ate it all up. 'Well,' said the sparrow, 'you\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"shall have some more if you will; so come with me to the next shop, and I will peck you down another steak.' When the dog had eaten this too, the sparrow said to him, 'Well, my good friend, have you had enough now?' 'I have had plenty of meat,'\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"answered he, 'but I should like to have a piece of bread to eat after it.' 'Come with me then,' said the sparrow, 'and you shall soon have that too.' So she took him to a baker's shop, and pecked at two rolls that lay in the window, till they fell down:\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and as the dog still wished for more, she took him to another shop and pecked down some more for him. When that was eaten, the sparrow asked him whether he had had enough now. 'Yes,' said he; 'and now let us take a walk a little way out of the town.' So\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"they both went out upon the high road; but as the weather was warm, they had not gone far before the dog said, 'I am very much tired--I should like to take a nap.' 'Very well,' answered the sparrow, 'do so, and in the meantime I will perch upon that\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"bush.' So the dog stretched himself out on the road, and fell fast asleep. Whilst he slept, there came by a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine. The sparrow, seeing that the carter did not turn out of the way, but\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"would go on in the track in which the dog lay, so as to drive over him, called out, 'Stop! stop! Mr Carter, or it shall be the worse for you.' But the carter, grumbling to himself, 'You make it the worse for me, indeed! what can you do?' cracked his\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"whip, and drove his cart over the poor dog, so that the wheels crushed him to death. 'There,' cried the sparrow, 'thou cruel villain, thou hast killed my friend the dog. Now mind what I say. This deed of thine shall cost thee all thou art worth.' 'Do\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"your worst, and welcome,' said the brute, 'what harm can you do me?' and passed on.

When the carter saw this, he drew out his hatchet and aimed a blow at the sparrow, meaning to kill her; but she flew away, and the blow fell upon the poor horse's head with such force, that he fell down dead.\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"'Unlucky wretch that I am!' cried he. 'Not wretch enough yet!' said the sparrow. And as the carter went on with the other two horses, she again crept under the tilt of the cart, and pecked out the bung of the second cask, so that all the wine ran out.\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"When the carter saw this, he again cried out, 'Miserable wretch that I am!'

'Unlucky wretch that I am!' said he. 'Not wretch enough yet!' said the sparrow; and perching upon the third horse, she began to peck him too. The carter\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"was mad with fury; and without looking about him, or caring what he was about, struck again at the sparrow; but killed his third horse as he done the other two. 'Alas! miserable wretch that I am!' cried he. 'Not wretch enough yet!' answered the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"sparrow as she flew away; 'now will I plague and punish thee at thy own house.' The carter was forced at last to leave his cart behind him, and to go home overflowing with rage and vexation. 'Alas!' said he to his wife, 'what ill luck has befallen\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"me!--my wine is all spilt, and my horses all three dead.' 'Alas! husband,' replied she, 'and a wicked bird has come into the house, and has brought with her all the birds in the world, I am sure, and they have fallen upon our corn in the loft, and are\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"eating it up at such a rate!' Away ran the husband upstairs, and saw thousands of birds sitting upon the floor eating up his corn, with the sparrow in the midst of them. 'Unlucky wretch that I am!' cried the carter; for he saw that the corn was almost\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"all gone. 'Not wretch enough yet!' said the sparrow; 'thy cruelty shall cost thee they life yet!' and away she flew. The carter seeing that he had thus lost all that he had, went down into his kitchen; and was still not sorry for what he had done, but\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"sat himself angrily and sulkily in the chimney corner. But the sparrow sat on the outside of the window, and cried 'Carter! thy cruelty shall cost thee thy life!'

The sparrow now hopped in, perched upon the window-seat, and cried, 'Carter! it shall cost thee thy life!' Then he became mad and blind with rage, and struck the window-seat with such force that he cleft it in two:\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and as the sparrow flew from place to place, the carter and his wife were so furious, that they broke all their furniture, glasses, chairs, benches, the table, and at last the walls, without touching the bird at all. In the end, however, they\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"caught her: and the wife said, 'Shall I kill her at once?' 'No,' cried he, 'that is letting her off too easily: she shall die a much more cruel death; I will eat her.' But the sparrow began to flutter about, and stretch out her neck and cried, 'Carter!\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"it shall cost thee thy life yet!' With that he could wait no longer: so he gave his wife the hatchet, and cried, 'Wife, strike at the bird and kill her in my hand.'

The fisherman used to go out all day long a-fishing; and one day, as he sat on the shore with his rod, looking at the sparkling waves and watching his line,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"all on a sudden his float was dragged away deep into the water: and in drawing it up he pulled out a great fish. But the fish said, 'Pray let me live! I am not a real fish; I am an enchanted prince: put me in the water again, and let me go!' 'Oh, ho!'\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"said the man, 'you need not make so many words about the matter; I will have nothing to do with a fish that can talk: so swim away, sir, as soon as you please!' Then he put him back into the water, and the fish darted straight down to the bottom, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"left a long streak of blood behind him on the wave. When the fisherman went home to his wife in the pigsty, he told her how he had caught a great fish, and how it had told him it was an enchanted prince, and how, on hearing it speak, he had let it go\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"again. 'Did not you ask it for anything?' said the wife, 'we live very wretchedly here, in this nasty dirty pigsty; do go back and tell the fish we want a snug little cottage.' The fisherman did not much like the business: however, he went to the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"seashore; and when he came back there the water looked all yellow and green. And he stood at the water's edge, and said: 'O man of the sea! Hearken to me! My wife Ilsabill Will have her own will, And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!' Then the fish\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"came swimming to him, and said, 'Well, what is her will? What does your wife want?' 'Ah!' said the fisherman, 'she says that when I had caught you, I ought to have asked you for something before I let you go; she does not like living any longer in the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"pigsty, and wants a snug little cottage.' 'Go home, then,' said the fish; 'she is in the cottage already!' So the man went home, and saw his wife standing at the door of a nice trim little cottage. 'Come in, come in!' said she; 'is not this much better\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"than the filthy pigsty we had?' And there was a parlour, and a bedchamber, and a kitchen; and behind the cottage there was a little garden, planted with all sorts of flowers and fruits; and there was a courtyard behind, full of ducks and chickens. 'Ah!'\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"said the fisherman, 'how happily we shall live now!' 'We will try to do so, at least,' said his wife. Everything went right for a week or two, and then Dame Ilsabill said, 'Husband, there is not near room enough for us in this cottage; the courtyard and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the garden are a great deal too small; I should like to have a large stone castle to live in: go to the fish again and tell him to give us a castle.' 'Wife,' said the fisherman, 'I don't like to go to him again, for perhaps he will be angry; we ought to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"be easy with this pretty cottage to live in.' 'Nonsense!' said the wife; 'he will do it very willingly, I know; go along and try!' The fisherman went, but his heart was very heavy: and when he came to the sea, it looked blue and gloomy, though it was\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"very calm; and he went close to the edge of the waves, and said: 'O man of the sea! Hearken to me! My wife Ilsabill Will have her own will, And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!' 'Well, what does she want now?' said the fish. 'Ah!' said the man,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"dolefully, 'my wife wants to live in a stone castle.' 'Go home, then,' said the fish; 'she is standing at the gate of it already.' So away went the fisherman, and found his wife standing before the gate of a great castle. 'See,' said she, 'is not this\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"grand?' With that they went into the castle together, and found a great many servants there, and the rooms all richly furnished, and full of golden chairs and tables; and behind the castle was a garden, and around it was a park half a mile long, full of\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"sheep, and goats, and hares, and deer; and in the courtyard were stables and cow-houses. 'Well,' said the man, 'now we will live cheerful and happy in this beautiful castle for the rest of our lives.' 'Perhaps we may,' said the wife; 'but let us sleep\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"upon it, before we make up our minds to that.' So they went to bed. The next morning when Dame Ilsabill awoke it was broad daylight, and she jogged the fisherman with her elbow, and said, 'Get up, husband, and bestir yourself, for we must be king of all\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the land.' 'Wife, wife,' said the man, 'why should we wish to be the king? I will not be king.' 'Then I will,' said she. 'But, wife,' said the fisherman, 'how can you be king--the fish cannot make you a king?' 'Husband,' said she, 'say no more about it,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"but go and try! I will be king.' So the man went away quite sorrowful to think that his wife should want to be king. This time the sea looked a dark grey colour, and was overspread with curling waves and the ridges of foam as he cried out: 'O man of the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"sea! Hearken to me! My wife Ilsabill Will have her own will, And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!' 'Well, what would she have now?' said the fish. 'Alas!' said the poor man, 'my wife wants to be king.' 'Go home,' said the fish; 'she is king already.'\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Then the fisherman went home; and as he came close to the palace he saw a troop of soldiers, and heard the sound of drums and trumpets. And when he went in he saw his wife sitting on a throne of gold and diamonds, with a golden crown upon her head; and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"on each side of her stood six fair maidens, each a head taller than the other. 'Well, wife,' said the fisherman, 'are you king?' 'Yes,' said she, 'I am king.' And when he had looked at her for a long time, he said, 'Ah, wife! what a fine thing it is to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"be king! Now we shall never have anything more to wish for as long as we live.' 'I don't know how that may be,' said she; 'never is a long time. I am king, it is true; but I begin to be tired of that, and I think I should like to be emperor.' 'Alas,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"wife! why should you wish to be emperor?' said the fisherman. 'Husband,' said she, 'go to the fish! I say I will be emperor.' 'Ah, wife!' replied the fisherman, 'the fish cannot make an emperor, I am sure, and I should not like to ask him for such a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"thing.' 'I am king,' said Ilsabill, 'and you are my slave; so go at once!' So the fisherman was forced to go; and he muttered as he went along, 'This will come to no good, it is too much to ask; the fish will be tired at last, and then we shall be sorry\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"for what we have done.' He soon came to the seashore; and the water was quite black and muddy, and a mighty whirlwind blew over the waves and rolled them about, but he went as near as he could to the water's brink, and said: 'O man of the sea! Hearken\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"to me! My wife Ilsabill Will have her own will, And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!' 'What would she have now?' said the fish. 'Ah!' said the fisherman, 'she wants to be emperor.' 'Go home,' said the fish; 'she is emperor already.' So he went home\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"again; and as he came near he saw his wife Ilsabill sitting on a very lofty throne made of solid gold, with a great crown on her head full two yards high; and on each side of her stood her guards and attendants in a row, each one smaller than the other,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"from the tallest giant down to a little dwarf no bigger than my finger. And before her stood princes, and dukes, and earls: and the fisherman went up to her and said, 'Wife, are you emperor?' 'Yes,' said she, 'I am emperor.' 'Ah!' said the man, as he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"gazed upon her, 'what a fine thing it is to be emperor!' 'Husband,' said she, 'why should we stop at being emperor? I will be pope next.' 'O wife, wife!' said he, 'how can you be pope? there is but one pope at a time in Christendom.' 'Husband,' said\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"she, 'I will be pope this very day.' 'But,' replied the husband, 'the fish cannot make you pope.' 'What nonsense!' said she; 'if he can make an emperor, he can make a pope: go and try him.' So the fisherman went. But when he came to the shore the wind\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"was raging and the sea was tossed up and down in boiling waves, and the ships were in trouble, and rolled fearfully upon the tops of the billows. In the middle of the heavens there was a little piece of blue sky, but towards the south all was red, as if\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"a dreadful storm was rising. At this sight the fisherman was dreadfully frightened, and he trembled so that his knees knocked together: but still he went down near to the shore, and said: 'O man of the sea! Hearken to me! My wife Ilsabill Will have\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"her own will, And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!' 'What does she want now?' said the fish. 'Ah!' said the fisherman, 'my wife wants to be pope.' 'Go home,' said the fish; 'she is pope already.' Then the fisherman went home, and found Ilsabill\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"sitting on a throne that was two miles high. And she had three great crowns on her head, and around her stood all the pomp and power of the Church. And on each side of her were two rows of burning lights, of all sizes, the greatest as large as the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"highest and biggest tower in the world, and the least no larger than a small rushlight. 'Wife,' said the fisherman, as he looked at all this greatness, 'are you pope?' 'Yes,' said she, 'I am pope.' 'Well, wife,' replied he, 'it is a grand thing to be\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"pope; and now you must be easy, for you can be nothing greater.' 'I will think about that,' said the wife. Then they went to bed: but Dame Ilsabill could not sleep all night for thinking what she should be next. At last, as she was dropping asleep,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"morning broke, and the sun rose. 'Ha!' thought she, as she woke up and looked at it through the window, 'after all I cannot prevent the sun rising.' At this thought she was very angry, and wakened her husband, and said, 'Husband, go to the fish and tell\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"him I must be lord of the sun and moon.' The fisherman was half asleep, but the thought frightened him so much that he started and fell out of bed. 'Alas, wife!' said he, 'cannot you be easy with being pope?' 'No,' said she, 'I am very uneasy as long as\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the sun and moon rise without my leave. Go to the fish at once!' Then the man went shivering with fear; and as he was going down to the shore a dreadful storm arose, so that the trees and the very rocks shook. And all the heavens became black with\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"stormy clouds, and the lightnings played, and the thunders rolled; and you might have seen in the sea great black waves, swelling up like mountains with crowns of white foam upon their heads. And the fisherman crept towards the sea, and cried out, as\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"well as he could: 'O man of the sea! Hearken to me! My wife Ilsabill Will have her own will, And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!' 'What does she want now?' said the fish. 'Ah!' said he, 'she wants to be lord of the sun and moon.' 'Go home,' said the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"fish, 'to your pigsty again.' And there they live to this very day.\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

Begin by learning some craft or another, and see how you can get on.' So the four brothers took their walking-sticks\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"in their hands, and their little bundles on their shoulders, and after bidding their father goodbye, went all out at the gate together. When they had got on some way they came to four crossways, each leading to a different country. Then the eldest said,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"'Here we must part; but this day four years we will come back to this spot, and in the meantime each must try what he can do for himself.' So each brother went his way; and as the eldest was hastening on a man met him, and asked him where he was going,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and what he wanted. 'I am going to try my luck in the world, and should like to begin by learning some art or trade,' answered he. 'Then,' said the man, 'go with me, and I will teach you to become the cunningest thief that ever was.' 'No,' said the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"other, 'that is not an honest calling, and what can one look to earn by it in the end but the gallows?' 'Oh!' said the man, 'you need not fear the gallows; for I will only teach you to steal what will be fair game: I meddle with nothing but what no one\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"else can get or care anything about, and where no one can find you out.' So the young man agreed to follow his trade, and he soon showed himself so clever, that nothing could escape him that he had once set his mind upon. The second brother also met a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"man, who, when he found out what he was setting out upon, asked him what craft he meant to follow. 'I do not know yet,' said he. 'Then come with me, and be a star-gazer. It is a noble art, for nothing can be hidden from you, when once you understand the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"stars.' The plan pleased him much, and he soon became such a skilful star-gazer, that when he had served out his time, and wanted to leave his master, he gave him a glass, and said, 'With this you can see all that is passing in the sky and on earth, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"nothing can be hidden from you.' The third brother met a huntsman, who took him with him, and taught him so well all that belonged to hunting, that he became very clever in the craft of the woods; and when he left his master he gave him a bow,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and said, 'Whatever you shoot at with this bow you will be sure to hit.' The youngest brother likewise met a man who asked him what he wished to do. 'Would not you like,' said he, 'to be a tailor?' 'Oh, no!' said the young man; 'sitting cross-legged\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"from morning to night, working backwards and forwards with a needle and goose, will never suit me.' 'Oh!' answered the man, 'that is not my sort of tailoring; come with me, and you will learn quite another kind of craft from that.' Not knowing what\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"better to do, he came into the plan, and learnt tailoring from the beginning; and when he left his master, he gave him a needle, and said, 'You can sew anything with this, be it as soft as an egg or as hard as steel; and the joint will be so fine that\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"no seam will be seen.' After the space of four years, at the time agreed upon, the four brothers met at the four cross-roads; and having welcomed each other, set off towards their father's home, where they told him all that had happened to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"them, and how each had learned some craft. Then, one day, as they were sitting before the house under a very high tree, the father said, 'I should like to try what each of you can do in this way.' So he looked up, and said to the second son, 'At the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"top of this tree there is a chaffinch's nest; tell me how many eggs there are in it.' The star-gazer took his glass, looked up, and said, 'Five.' 'Now,' said the father to the eldest son, 'take away the eggs without letting the bird that is sitting upon\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"them and hatching them know anything of what you are doing.' So the cunning thief climbed up the tree, and brought away to his father the five eggs from under the bird; and it never saw or felt what he was doing, but kept sitting on at its ease. Then\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the father took the eggs, and put one on each corner of the table, and the fifth in the middle, and said to the huntsman, 'Cut all the eggs in two pieces at one shot.' The huntsman took up his bow, and at one shot struck all the five eggs as his father\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"wished. 'Now comes your turn,' said he to the young tailor; 'sew the eggs and the young birds in them together again, so neatly that the shot shall have done them no harm.' Then the tailor took his needle, and sewed the eggs as he was told; and when he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"had done, the thief was sent to take them back to the nest, and put them under the bird without its knowing it. Then she went on sitting, and hatched them: and in a few days they crawled out, and had only a little red streak across their necks, where\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the tailor had sewn them together. 'Well done, sons!' said the old man; 'you have made good use of your time, and learnt something worth the knowing; but I am sure I do not know which ought to have the prize. Oh, that a time might soon come for you to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"turn your skill to some account!' Not long after this there was a great bustle in the country; for the king's daughter had been carried off by a mighty dragon, and the king mourned over his loss day and night, and made it known that whoever brought her\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"back to him should have her for a wife. Then the four brothers said to each other, 'Here is a chance for us; let us try what we can do.' And they agreed to see whether they could not set the princess free. 'I will soon find out where she is, however,'\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"said the star-gazer, as he looked through his glass; and he soon cried out, 'I see her afar off, sitting upon a rock in the sea, and I can spy the dragon close by, guarding her.' Then he went to the king, and asked for a ship for himself and his\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"brothers; and they sailed together over the sea, till they came to the right place. There they found the princess sitting, as the star-gazer had said, on the rock; and the dragon was lying asleep, with his head upon her lap. 'I dare not shoot at him,'\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"said the huntsman, 'for I should kill the beautiful young lady also.' 'Then I will try my skill,' said the thief, and went and stole her away from under the dragon, so quietly and gently that the beast did not know it, but went on snoring. Then away\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"they hastened with her full of joy in their boat towards the ship; but soon came the dragon roaring behind them through the air; for he awoke and missed the princess. But when he got over the boat, and wanted to pounce upon them and carry off the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"princess, the huntsman took up his bow and shot him straight through the heart so that he fell down dead. They were still not safe; for he was such a great beast that in his fall he overset the boat, and they had to swim in the open sea upon a few\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"planks. So the tailor took his needle, and with a few large stitches put some of the planks together; and he sat down upon these, and sailed about and gathered up all pieces of the boat; and then tacked them together so quickly that the boat was soon\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"ready, and they then reached the ship and got home safe. When they had brought home the princess to her father, there was great rejoicing; and he said to the four brothers, 'One of you shall marry her, but you must settle amongst yourselves which it is\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"to be.' Then there arose a quarrel between them; and the star-gazer said, 'If I had not found the princess out, all your skill would have been of no use; therefore she ought to be mine.' 'Your seeing her would have been of no use,' said the thief, 'if I\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"had not taken her away from the dragon; therefore she ought to be mine.' 'No, she is mine,' said the huntsman; 'for if I had not killed the dragon, he would, after all, have torn you and the princess into pieces.' 'And if I had not sewn the boat\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"together again,' said the tailor, 'you would all have been drowned, therefore she is mine.' Then the king put in a word, and said, 'Each of you is right; and as all cannot have the young lady, the best way is for neither of you to have her: for the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"truth is, there is somebody she likes a great deal better. But to make up for your loss, I will give each of you, as a reward for his skill, half a kingdom.' So the brothers agreed that this plan would be much better than either quarrelling or marrying\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"a lady who had no mind to have them. And the king then gave to each half a kingdom, as he had said; and they lived very happily the rest of their days, and took good care of their father; and somebody took better care of the young lady, than to let\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"either the dragon or one of the craftsmen have her again.\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

One day Frederick said. 'Kate! I am going to work in the fields; when I come back I shall be hungry so let me have something nice cooked,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and a good draught of ale.' 'Very well,' said she, 'it shall all be ready.' When dinner-time drew nigh, Catherine took a nice steak, which was all the meat she had, and put it on the fire to fry. The steak soon began to look brown, and to crackle in the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"pan; and Catherine stood by with a fork and turned it: then she said to herself, 'The steak is almost ready, I may as well go to the cellar for the ale.' So she left the pan on the fire and took a large jug and went into the cellar and tapped the ale\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"cask. The beer ran into the jug and Catherine stood looking on. At last it popped into her head, 'The dog is not shut up--he may be running away with the steak; that's well thought of.' So up she ran from the cellar; and sure enough the rascally cur had\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"got the steak in his mouth, and was making off with it. Away ran Catherine, and away ran the dog across the field: but he ran faster than she, and stuck close to the steak. 'It's all gone, and \\\\\\\"what can't be cured must be endured\\\\\\\",' said Catherine. So\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"she turned round; and as she had run a good way and was tired, she walked home leisurely to cool herself. Now all this time the ale was running too, for Catherine had not turned the cock; and when the jug was full the liquor ran upon the floor till the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"cask was empty. When she got to the cellar stairs she saw what had happened. 'My stars!' said she, 'what shall I do to keep Frederick from seeing all this slopping about?' So she thought a while; and at last remembered that there was a sack\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"of fine meal bought at the last fair, and that if she sprinkled this over the floor it would suck up the ale nicely. 'What a lucky thing,' said she, 'that we kept that meal! we have now a good use for it.' So away she went for it: but she managed to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"set it down just upon the great jug full of beer, and upset it; and thus all the ale that had been saved was set swimming on the floor also. 'Ah! well,' said she, 'when one goes another may as well follow.' Then she strewed the meal all about the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"cellar, and was quite pleased with her cleverness, and said, 'How very neat and clean it looks!' At noon Frederick came home. 'Now, wife,' cried he, 'what have you for dinner?' 'O Frederick!' answered she, 'I was cooking you a steak; but while I went\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"down to draw the ale, the dog ran away with it; and while I ran after him, the ale ran out; and when I went to dry up the ale with the sack of meal that we got at the fair, I upset the jug: but the cellar is now quite dry, and looks so clean!' 'Kate,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Kate,' said he, 'how could you do all this?' Why did you leave the steak to fry, and the ale to run, and then spoil all the meal?' 'Why, Frederick,' said she, 'I did not know I was doing wrong; you should have told me before.' The husband thought to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"himself, 'If my wife manages matters thus, I must look sharp myself.' Now he had a good deal of gold in the house: so he said to Catherine, 'What pretty yellow buttons these are! I shall put them into a box and bury them in the garden; but take care\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"that you never go near or meddle with them.' 'No, Frederick,' said she, 'that I never will.' As soon as he was gone, there came by some pedlars with earthenware plates and dishes, and they asked her whether she would buy. 'Oh dear me, I should like to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"buy very much, but I have no money: if you had any use for yellow buttons, I might deal with you.' 'Yellow buttons!' said they: 'let us have a look at them.' 'Go into the garden and dig where I tell you, and you will find the yellow buttons: I dare not\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"go myself.' So the rogues went: and when they found what these yellow buttons were, they took them all away, and left her plenty of plates and dishes. Then she set them all about the house for a show: and when Frederick came back, he cried out, 'Kate,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"what have you been doing?' 'See,' said she, 'I have bought all these with your yellow buttons: but I did not touch them myself; the pedlars went themselves and dug them up.' 'Wife, wife,' said Frederick, 'what a pretty piece of work you have made! those\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"yellow buttons were all my money: how came you to do such a thing?' 'Why,' answered she, 'I did not know there was any harm in it; you should have told me.' Catherine stood musing for a while, and at last said to her husband, 'Hark ye, Frederick, we\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"will soon get the gold back: let us run after the thieves.' 'Well, we will try,' answered he; 'but take some butter and cheese with you, that we may have something to eat by the way.' 'Very well,' said she; and they set out: and as Frederick walked the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"fastest, he left his wife some way behind. 'It does not matter,' thought she: 'when we turn back, I shall be so much nearer home than he.' Presently she came to the top of a hill, down the side of which there was a road so narrow that the cart wheels\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"always chafed the trees on each side as they passed. 'Ah, see now,' said she, 'how they have bruised and wounded those poor trees; they will never get well.' So she took pity on them, and made use of the butter to grease them all, so that the wheels\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"might not hurt them so much. While she was doing this kind office one of her cheeses fell out of the basket, and rolled down the hill. Catherine looked, but could not see where it had gone; so she said, 'Well, I suppose the other will go the same way\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and find you; he has younger legs than I have.' Then she rolled the other cheese after it; and away it went, nobody knows where, down the hill. But she said she supposed that they knew the road, and would follow her, and she could not stay there all day\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"waiting for them. At last she overtook Frederick, who desired her to give him something to eat. Then she gave him the dry bread. 'Where are the butter and cheese?' said he. 'Oh!' answered she, 'I used the butter to grease those poor trees that the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"wheels chafed so: and one of the cheeses ran away so I sent the other after it to find it, and I suppose they are both on the road together somewhere.' 'What a goose you are to do such silly things!' said the husband. 'How can you say so?' said she; 'I\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"am sure you never told me not.' They ate the dry bread together; and Frederick said, 'Kate, I hope you locked the door safe when you came away.' 'No,' answered she, 'you did not tell me.' 'Then go home, and do it now before we go any farther,' said\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Frederick, 'and bring with you something to eat.' Catherine did as he told her, and thought to herself by the way, 'Frederick wants something to eat; but I don't think he is very fond of butter and cheese: I'll bring him a bag of fine nuts, and the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"vinegar, for I have often seen him take some.' When she reached home, she bolted the back door, but the front door she took off the hinges, and said, 'Frederick told me to lock the door, but surely it can nowhere be so safe if I take it with me.' So she\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"took her time by the way; and when she overtook her husband she cried out, 'There, Frederick, there is the door itself, you may watch it as carefully as you please.' 'Alas! alas!' said he, 'what a clever wife I have! I sent you to make the house\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"fast, and you take the door away, so that everybody may go in and out as they please--however, as you have brought the door, you shall carry it about with you for your pains.' 'Very well,' answered she, 'I'll carry the door; but I'll not carry the nuts\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and vinegar bottle also--that would be too much of a load; so if you please, I'll fasten them to the door.' Frederick of course made no objection to that plan, and they set off into the wood to look for the thieves; but they could not find them: and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"when it grew dark, they climbed up into a tree to spend the night there. Scarcely were they up, than who should come by but the very rogues they were looking for. They were in truth great rascals, and belonged to that class of people who find things\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"before they are lost; they were tired; so they sat down and made a fire under the very tree where Frederick and Catherine were. Frederick slipped down on the other side, and picked up some stones. Then he climbed up again, and tried to hit the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"thieves on the head with them: but they only said, 'It must be near morning, for the wind shakes the fir-apples down.' Catherine, who had the door on her shoulder, began to be very tired; but she thought it was the nuts upon it that were so heavy: so\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"she said softly, 'Frederick, I must let the nuts go.' 'No,' answered he, 'not now, they will discover us.' 'I can't help that: they must go.' 'Well, then, make haste and throw them down, if you will.' Then away rattled the nuts down among the boughs and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"one of the thieves cried, 'Bless me, it is hailing.' A little while after, Catherine thought the door was still very heavy: so she whispered to Frederick, 'I must throw the vinegar down.' 'Pray don't,' answered he, 'it will discover us.' 'I can't help\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"that,' said she, 'go it must.' So she poured all the vinegar down; and the thieves said, 'What a heavy dew there is!' At last it popped into Catherine's head that it was the door itself that was so heavy all the time: so she whispered, 'Frederick, I\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"must throw the door down soon.' But he begged and prayed her not to do so, for he was sure it would betray them. 'Here goes, however,' said she: and down went the door with such a clatter upon the thieves, that they cried out 'Murder!' and not knowing\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"what was coming, ran away as fast as they could, and left all the gold. So when Frederick and Catherine came down, there they found all their money safe and sound.\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

Now she had a golden ball\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"in her hand, which was her favourite plaything; and she was always tossing it up into the air, and catching it again as it fell. After a time she threw it up so high that she missed catching it as it fell; and the ball bounded away, and rolled along\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"upon the ground, till at last it fell down into the spring. The princess looked into the spring after her ball, but it was very deep, so deep that she could not see the bottom of it. Then she began to bewail her loss, and said, 'Alas! if I could only\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"get my ball again, I would give all my fine clothes and jewels, and everything that I have in the world.' Whilst she was speaking, a frog put its head out of the water, and said, 'Princess, why do you weep so bitterly?' 'Alas!' said she, 'what can you\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"do for me, you nasty frog? My golden ball has fallen into the spring.' The frog said, 'I want not your pearls, and jewels, and fine clothes; but if you will love me, and let me live with you and eat from off your golden plate, and sleep upon your bed, I\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"will bring you your ball again.' 'What nonsense,' thought the princess, 'this silly frog is talking! He can never even get out of the spring to visit me, though he may be able to get my ball for me, and therefore I will tell him he shall have what he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"asks.' So she said to the frog, 'Well, if you will bring me my ball, I will do all you ask.' Then the frog put his head down, and dived deep under the water; and after a little while he came up again, with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the edge\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"of the spring. As soon as the young princess saw her ball, she ran to pick it up; and she was so overjoyed to have it in her hand again, that she never thought of the frog, but ran home with it as fast as she could. The frog called after her, 'Stay,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"princess, and take me with you as you said,' But she did not stop to hear a word. The next day, just as the princess had sat down to dinner, she heard a strange noise--tap, tap--plash, plash--as if something was coming up the marble\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"staircase: and soon afterwards there was a gentle knock at the door, and a little voice cried out and said: 'Open the door, my princess dear, Open the door to thy true love here! And mind the words that thou and I said By the fountain cool, in the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"greenwood shade.' Then the princess ran to the door and opened it, and there she saw the frog, whom she had quite forgotten. At this sight she was sadly frightened, and shutting the door as fast as she could came back to her seat. The king, her\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"father, seeing that something had frightened her, asked her what was the matter. 'There is a nasty frog,' said she, 'at the door, that lifted my ball for me out of the spring this morning: I told him that he should live with me here, thinking that he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"could never get out of the spring; but there he is at the door, and he wants to come in.' While she was speaking the frog knocked again at the door, and said: 'Open the door, my princess dear, Open the door to thy true love here! And mind the words that\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"thou and I said By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.' Then the king said to the young princess, 'As you have given your word you must keep it; so go and let him in.' She did so, and the frog hopped into the room, and then straight on--tap,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"tap--plash, plash--from the bottom of the room to the top, till he came up close to the table where the princess sat. 'Pray lift me upon chair,' said he to the princess, 'and let me sit next to you.' As soon as she had done this, the frog said, 'Put\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"your plate nearer to me, that I may eat out of it.' This she did, and when he had eaten as much as he could, he said, 'Now I am tired; carry me upstairs, and put me into your bed.' And the princess, though very unwilling, took him up in her hand, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"put him upon the pillow of her own bed, where he slept all night long. As soon as it was light he jumped up, hopped downstairs, and went out of the house. 'Now, then,' thought the princess, 'at last he is gone, and I shall be troubled with him no more.'\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"But she was mistaken; for when night came again she heard the same tapping at the door; and the frog came once more, and said: 'Open the door, my princess dear, Open the door to thy true love here! And mind the words that thou and I said By the fountain\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"cool, in the greenwood shade.' And when the princess opened the door the frog came in, and slept upon her pillow as before, till the morning broke. And the third night he did the same. But when the princess awoke on the following morning she was\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"astonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome prince, gazing on her with the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen, and standing at the head of her bed. He told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy, who had changed him into a frog;\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and that he had been fated so to abide till some princess should take him out of the spring, and let him eat from her plate, and sleep upon her bed for three nights. 'You,' said the prince, 'have broken his cruel charm, and now I have nothing to wish\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"for but that you should go with me into my father's kingdom, where I will marry you, and love you as long as you live.' The young princess, you may be sure, was not long in saying 'Yes' to all this; and as they spoke a gay coach drove up, with eight\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"beautiful horses, decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness; and behind the coach rode the prince's servant, faithful Heinrich, who had bewailed the misfortunes of his dear master during his enchantment so long and so\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"bitterly, that his heart had well-nigh burst. They then took leave of the king, and got into the coach with eight horses, and all set out, full of joy and merriment, for the prince's kingdom, which they reached safely; and there they lived happily a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"great many years.\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

You must go straight on till you come to the castle where the horse stands in his stall: by his side will lie the groom fast asleep and snoring: take away the horse quietly, but be sure to put the old leathern saddle upon him, and not\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the golden one that is close by it.' Then the son sat down on the fox's tail, and away they went over stock and stone till their hair whistled in the wind. All went right, and the groom lay snoring with his hand upon the golden saddle. But when the son\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"looked at the horse, he thought it a great pity to put the leathern saddle upon it. 'I will give him the good one,' said he; 'I am sure he deserves it.' As he took up the golden saddle the groom awoke and cried out so loud, that all the guards ran in\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and took him prisoner, and in the morning he was again brought before the court to be judged, and was sentenced to die. But it was agreed, that, if he could bring thither the beautiful princess, he should live, and have the bird and the horse\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"given him for his own. Then he went his way very sorrowful; but the old fox came and said, 'Why did not you listen to me? If you had, you would have carried away both the bird and the horse; yet will I once more give you counsel. Go straight on, and in\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the evening you will arrive at a castle. At twelve o'clock at night the princess goes to the bathing-house: go up to her and give her a kiss, and she will let you lead her away; but take care you do not suffer her to go and take leave of her father and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"mother.' Then the fox stretched out his tail, and so away they went over stock and stone till their hair whistled again. As they came to the castle, all was as the fox had said, and at twelve o'clock the young man met the princess going to the bath and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"gave her the kiss, and she agreed to run away with him, but begged with many tears that he would let her take leave of her father. At first he refused, but she wept still more and more, and fell at his feet, till at last he consented; but the moment she\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"came to her father's house the guards awoke and he was taken prisoner again. Then he was brought before the king, and the king said, 'You shall never have my daughter unless in eight days you dig away the hill that stops the view from my window.'\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Now this hill was so big that the whole world could not take it away: and when he had worked for seven days, and had done very little, the fox came and said. 'Lie down and go to sleep; I will work for you.' And in the morning he awoke and the hill was\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"gone; so he went merrily to the king, and told him that now that it was removed he must give him the princess. Then the king was obliged to keep his word, and away went the young man and the princess; and the fox came and said to him, 'We will have all\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"three, the princess, the horse, and the bird.' 'Ah!' said the young man, 'that would be a great thing, but how can you contrive it?' 'If you will only listen,' said the fox, 'it can be done. When you come to the king, and he asks for the beautiful\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"princess, you must say, \\\\\\\"Here she is!\\\\\\\" Then he will be very joyful; and you will mount the golden horse that they are to give you, and put out your hand to take leave of them; but shake hands with the princess last. Then lift her quickly on to the horse\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"behind you; clap your spurs to his side, and gallop away as fast as you can.' All went right: then the fox said, 'When you come to the castle where the bird is, I will stay with the princess at the door, and you will ride in and speak to the king; and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"when he sees that it is the right horse, he will bring out the bird; but you must sit still, and say that you want to look at it, to see whether it is the true golden bird; and when you get it into your hand, ride away.' This, too, happened as the fox\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"said; they carried off the bird, the princess mounted again, and they rode on to a great wood. Then the fox came, and said, 'Pray kill me, and cut off my head and my feet.' But the young man refused to do it: so the fox said, 'I will at any rate give\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"you good counsel: beware of two things; ransom no one from the gallows, and sit down by the side of no river.' Then away he went. 'Well,' thought the young man, 'it is no hard matter to keep that advice.' He rode on with the princess, till at last he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"came to the village where he had left his two brothers. And there he heard a great noise and uproar; and when he asked what was the matter, the people said, 'Two men are going to be hanged.' As he came nearer, he saw that the two men were his\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"brothers, who had turned robbers; so he said, 'Cannot they in any way be saved?' But the people said 'No,' unless he would bestow all his money upon the rascals and buy their liberty. Then he did not stay to think about the matter, but paid what was\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"asked, and his brothers were given up, and went on with him towards their home. And as they came to the wood where the fox first met them, it was so cool and pleasant that the two brothers said, 'Let us sit down by the side of the river, and rest a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"while, to eat and drink.' So he said, 'Yes,' and forgot the fox's counsel, and sat down on the side of the river; and while he suspected nothing, they came behind, and threw him down the bank, and took the princess, the horse, and the bird, and went\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"home to the king their master, and said. 'All this have we won by our labour.' Then there was great rejoicing made; but the horse would not eat, the bird would not sing, and the princess wept. The youngest son fell to the bottom of the river's bed:\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"luckily it was nearly dry, but his bones were almost broken, and the bank was so steep that he could find no way to get out. Then the old fox came once more, and scolded him for not following his advice; otherwise no evil would have befallen him: 'Yet,'\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"said he, 'I cannot leave you here, so lay hold of my tail and hold fast.' Then he pulled him out of the river, and said to him, as he got upon the bank, 'Your brothers have set watch to kill you, if they find you in the kingdom.' So he dressed himself\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"as a poor man, and came secretly to the king's court, and was scarcely within the doors when the horse began to eat, and the bird to sing, and princess left off weeping. Then he went to the king, and told him all his brothers' roguery; and they were\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"seized and punished, and he had the princess given to him again; and after the king's death he was heir to his kingdom. A long while after, he went to walk one day in the wood, and the old fox met him, and besought him with tears in his eyes to kill\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"him, and cut off his head and feet. And at last he did so, and in a moment the fox was changed into a man, and turned out to be the brother of the princess, who had been lost a great many many years.\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

It happened that the eldest wanted to go into the forest to hew wood, and before he went his mother\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"gave him a beautiful sweet cake and a bottle of wine in order that he might not suffer from hunger or thirst. When he entered the forest he met a little grey-haired old man who bade him good day, and said: 'Do give me a piece of cake out of your\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"pocket, and let me have a draught of your wine; I am so hungry and thirsty.' But the clever son answered: 'If I give you my cake and wine, I shall have none for myself; be off with you,' and he left the little man standing and went on. But when he began\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"to hew down a tree, it was not long before he made a false stroke, and the axe cut him in the arm, so that he had to go home and have it bound up. And this was the little grey man's doing. After this the second son went into the forest, and his mother\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"gave him, like the eldest, a cake and a bottle of wine. The little old grey man met him likewise, and asked him for a piece of cake and a drink of wine. But the second son, too, said sensibly enough: 'What I give you will be taken away from myself; be\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"off!' and he left the little man standing and went on. His punishment, however, was not delayed; when he had made a few blows at the tree he struck himself in the leg, so that he had to be carried home. Then Dummling said: 'Father, do let me\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"go and cut wood.' The father answered: 'Your brothers have hurt themselves with it, leave it alone, you do not understand anything about it.' But Dummling begged so long that at last he said: 'Just go then, you will get wiser by hurting yourself.' His\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"mother gave him a cake made with water and baked in the cinders, and with it a bottle of sour beer. When he came to the forest the little old grey man met him likewise, and greeting him, said: 'Give me a piece of your cake and a drink out of your\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"bottle; I am so hungry and thirsty.' Dummling answered: 'I have only cinder-cake and sour beer; if that pleases you, we will sit down and eat.' So they sat down, and when Dummling pulled out his cinder-cake, it was a fine sweet cake, and the sour beer\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"had become good wine. So they ate and drank, and after that the little man said: 'Since you have a good heart, and are willing to divide what you have, I will give you good luck. There stands an old tree, cut it down, and you will find something at the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"roots.' Then the little man took leave of him. Dummling went and cut down the tree, and when it fell there was a goose sitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold. He lifted her up, and taking her with him, went to an inn where he thought he would\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"stay the night. Now the host had three daughters, who saw the goose and were curious to know what such a wonderful bird might be, and would have liked to have one of its golden feathers. The eldest thought: 'I shall soon find an opportunity of\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"pulling out a feather,' and as soon as Dummling had gone out she seized the goose by the wing, but her finger and hand remained sticking fast to it. The second came soon afterwards, thinking only of how she might get a feather for herself, but she\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"had scarcely touched her sister than she was held fast. At last the third also came with the like intent, and the others screamed out: 'Keep away; for goodness' sake keep away!' But she did not understand why she was to keep away. 'The others are\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"there,' she thought, 'I may as well be there too,' and ran to them; but as soon as she had touched her sister, she remained sticking fast to her. So they had to spend the night with the goose. The next morning Dummling took the goose under his arm and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"set out, without troubling himself about the three girls who were hanging on to it. They were obliged to run after him continually, now left, now right, wherever his legs took him. In the middle of the fields the parson met them, and when he saw the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"procession he said: 'For shame, you good-for-nothing girls, why are you running across the fields after this young man? Is that seemly?' At the same time he seized the youngest by the hand in order to pull her away, but as soon as he touched her he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"likewise stuck fast, and was himself obliged to run behind. Before long the sexton came by and saw his master, the parson, running behind three girls. He was astonished at this and called out: 'Hi! your reverence, whither away so quickly? Do not\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"forget that we have a christening today!' and running after him he took him by the sleeve, but was also held fast to it. Whilst the five were trotting thus one behind the other, two labourers came with their hoes from the fields; the parson called out\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"to them and begged that they would set him and the sexton free. But they had scarcely touched the sexton when they were held fast, and now there were seven of them running behind Dummling and the goose. Soon afterwards he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"came to a city, where a king ruled who had a daughter who was so serious that no one could make her laugh. So he had put forth a decree that whosoever should be able to make her laugh should marry her. When Dummling heard this, he went with his goose\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and all her train before the king's daughter, and as soon as she saw the seven people running on and on, one behind the other, she began to laugh quite loudly, and as if she would never stop. Thereupon Dummling asked to have her for his wife; but\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the king did not like the son-in-law, and made all manner of excuses and said he must first produce a man who could drink a cellarful of wine. Dummling thought of the little grey man, who could certainly help him; so he went into the forest, and in the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"same place where he had felled the tree, he saw a man sitting, who had a very sorrowful face. Dummling asked him what he was taking to heart so sorely, and he answered: 'I have such a great thirst and cannot quench it; cold water I cannot stand, a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"barrel of wine I have just emptied, but that to me is like a drop on a hot stone!' 'There, I can help you,' said Dummling, 'just come with me and you shall be satisfied.' He led him into the king's cellar, and the man bent over the huge barrels, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"drank and drank till his loins hurt, and before the day was out he had emptied all the barrels. Then Dummling asked once more for his bride, but the king was vexed that such an ugly fellow, whom everyone called Dummling, should take away his\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"daughter, and he made a new condition; he must first find a man who could eat a whole mountain of bread. Dummling did not think long, but went straight into the forest, where in the same place there sat a man who was tying up his body with a strap, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"making an awful face, and saying: 'I have eaten a whole ovenful of rolls, but what good is that when one has such a hunger as I? My stomach remains empty, and I must tie myself up if I am not to die of hunger.' At this Dummling was glad, and said: 'Get\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"up and come with me; you shall eat yourself full.' He led him to the king's palace where all the flour in the whole Kingdom was collected, and from it he caused a huge mountain of bread to be baked. The man from the forest stood before it,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"began to eat, and by the end of one day the whole mountain had vanished. Then Dummling for the third time asked for his bride; but the king again sought a way out, and ordered a ship which could sail on land and on water. 'As soon as you come sailing\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"back in it,' said he, 'you shall have my daughter for wife.' Dummling went straight into the forest, and there sat the little grey man to whom he had given his cake. When he heard what Dummling wanted, he said: 'Since you have given me to eat and to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"drink, I will give you the ship; and I do all this because you once were kind to me.' Then he gave him the ship which could sail on land and water, and when the king saw that, he could no longer prevent him from having his daughter. The wedding was\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"celebrated, and after the king's death, Dummling inherited his kingdom and lived for a long time contentedly with his wife.\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

And as she leaned down to drink, the lock of hair fell from her bosom, and floated away with the water. Now she was so frightened that she did not see it; but her maid saw it, and was very glad, for she\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"knew the charm; and she saw that the poor bride would be in her power, now that she had lost the hair. So when the bride had done drinking, and would have got upon Falada again, the maid said, 'I shall ride upon Falada, and you may have my horse\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"instead'; so she was forced to give up her horse, and soon afterwards to take off her royal clothes and put on her maid's shabby ones. At last, as they drew near the end of their journey, this treacherous servant threatened to kill her mistress\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"if she ever told anyone what had happened. But Falada saw it all, and marked it well. Then the waiting-maid got upon Falada, and the real bride rode upon the other horse, and they went on in this way till at last they came to the royal court. There was\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"great joy at their coming, and the prince flew to meet them, and lifted the maid from her horse, thinking she was the one who was to be his wife; and she was led upstairs to the royal chamber; but the true princess was told to stay in the court below.\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Now the old king happened just then to have nothing else to do; so he amused himself by sitting at his kitchen window, looking at what was going on; and he saw her in the courtyard. As she looked very pretty, and too delicate for a waiting-maid, he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"went up into the royal chamber to ask the bride who it was she had brought with her, that was thus left standing in the court below. 'I brought her with me for the sake of her company on the road,' said she; 'pray give the girl some work to do, that\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"she may not be idle.' The old king could not for some time think of any work for her to do; but at last he said, 'I have a lad who takes care of my geese; she may go and help him.' Now the name of this lad, that the real bride was to help in watching\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the king's geese, was Curdken. But the false bride said to the prince, 'Dear husband, pray do me one piece of kindness.' 'That I will,' said the prince. 'Then tell one of your slaughterers to cut off the head of the horse I rode upon, for it was very\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"unruly, and plagued me sadly on the road'; but the truth was, she was very much afraid lest Falada should some day or other speak, and tell all she had done to the princess. She carried her point, and the faithful Falada was killed;\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"but when the true princess heard of it, she wept, and begged the man to nail up Falada's head against a large dark gate of the city, through which she had to pass every morning and evening, that there she might still see him sometimes. Then\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the slaughterer said he would do as she wished; and cut off the head, and nailed it up under the dark gate. Early the next morning, as she and Curdken went out through the gate, she said sorrowfully: 'Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!' and the head\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"answered: 'Bride, bride, there thou gangest! Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it, Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.' Then they went out of the city, and drove the geese on. And when she came to the meadow, she sat down upon a bank there, and let down her\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"waving locks of hair, which were all of pure silver; and when Curdken saw it glitter in the sun, he ran up, and would have pulled some of the locks out, but she cried: 'Blow, breezes, blow! Let Curdken's hat go! Blow, breezes, blow! Let him after it go!\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"O'er hills, dales, and rocks, Away be it whirl'd Till the silvery locks Are all comb'd and curl'd! Then there came a wind, so strong that it blew off Curdken's hat; and away it flew over the hills: and he was forced to turn and run after it; till, by\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the time he came back, she had done combing and curling her hair, and had put it up again safe. Then he was very angry and sulky, and would not speak to her at all; but they watched the geese until it grew dark in the evening, and then drove them\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"homewards. The next morning, as they were going through the dark gate, the poor girl looked up at Falada's head, and cried: 'Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!' and the head answered: 'Bride, bride, there thou gangest! Alas! alas! if they\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"mother knew it, Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.' Then she drove on the geese, and sat down again in the meadow, and began to comb out her hair as before; and Curdken ran up to her, and wanted to take hold of it; but she cried out quickly: 'Blow,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"breezes, blow! Let Curdken's hat go! Blow, breezes, blow! Let him after it go! O'er hills, dales, and rocks, Away be it whirl'd Till the silvery locks Are all comb'd and curl'd! Then the wind came and blew away his hat; and off it flew a great way, over\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the hills and far away, so that he had to run after it; and when he came back she had bound up her hair again, and all was safe. So they watched the geese till it grew dark. In the evening, after they came home, Curdken went to the old king, and said,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"'I cannot have that strange girl to help me to keep the geese any longer.' 'Why?' said the king. 'Because, instead of doing any good, she does nothing but tease me all day long.' Then the king made him tell him what had happened. And Curdken said,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"'When we go in the morning through the dark gate with our flock of geese, she cries and talks with the head of a horse that hangs upon the wall, and says: 'Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!' and the head answers: 'Bride, bride, there thou gangest!\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Alas! alas! if they mother knew it, Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.' And Curdken went on telling the king what had happened upon the meadow where the geese fed; how his hat was blown away; and how he was forced to run after it, and to leave his flock of\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"geese to themselves. But the old king told the boy to go out again the next day: and when morning came, he placed himself behind the dark gate, and heard how she spoke to Falada, and how Falada answered. Then he went into the field, and hid\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"himself in a bush by the meadow's side; and he soon saw with his own eyes how they drove the flock of geese; and how, after a little time, she let down her hair that glittered in the sun. And then he heard her say: 'Blow, breezes, blow! Let Curdken's\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"hat go! Blow, breezes, blow! Let him after it go! O'er hills, dales, and rocks, Away be it whirl'd Till the silvery locks Are all comb'd and curl'd! And soon came a gale of wind, and carried away Curdken's hat, and away went Curdken after it, while the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"girl went on combing and curling her hair. All this the old king saw: so he went home without being seen; and when the little goose-girl came back in the evening he called her aside, and asked her why she did so: but she burst into tears, and said,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"'That I must not tell you or any man, or I shall lose my life.' But the old king begged so hard, that she had no peace till she had told him all the tale, from beginning to end, word for word. And it was very lucky for her that she did so, for when she\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"had done the king ordered royal clothes to be put upon her, and gazed on her with wonder, she was so beautiful. Then he called his son and told him that he had only a false bride; for that she was merely a waiting-maid, while the true bride stood\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"by. And the young king rejoiced when he saw her beauty, and heard how meek and patient she had been; and without saying anything to the false bride, the king ordered a great feast to be got ready for all his court. The bridegroom sat at the top, with\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the false princess on one side, and the true one on the other; but nobody knew her again, for her beauty was quite dazzling to their eyes; and she did not seem at all like the little goose-girl, now that she had her brilliant dress on. When they had\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"eaten and drank, and were very merry, the old king said he would tell them a tale. So he began, and told all the story of the princess, as if it was one that he had once heard; and he asked the true waiting-maid what she thought ought to be done to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"anyone who would behave thus. 'Nothing better,' said this false bride, 'than that she should be thrown into a cask stuck round with sharp nails, and that two white horses should be put to it, and should drag it from street to street till she was dead.'\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"'Thou art she!' said the old king; 'and as thou has judged thyself, so shall it be done to thee.' And the young king was then married to his true wife, and they reigned over the kingdom in peace and happiness all their lives; and the good fairy came to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"see them, and restored the faithful Falada to life again.\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

The world may very likely not always think of them as they think of themselves, but what care they for the world? what can it know about the matter? One of these lucky beings was neighbour Hans. Seven long years\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"he had worked hard for his master. At last he said, 'Master, my time is up; I must go home and see my poor mother once more: so pray pay me my wages and let me go.' And the master said, 'You have been a faithful and good servant, Hans, so your pay\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"shall be handsome.' Then he gave him a lump of silver as big as his head. Hans took out his pocket-handkerchief, put the piece of silver into it, threw it over his shoulder, and jogged off on his road homewards. As he went lazily on, dragging one foot\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"after another, a man came in sight, trotting gaily along on a capital horse. 'Ah!' said Hans aloud, 'what a fine thing it is to ride on horseback! There he sits as easy and happy as if he was at home, in the chair by his fireside; he trips against no\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"stones, saves shoe-leather, and gets on he hardly knows how.' Hans did not speak so softly but the horseman heard it all, and said, 'Well, friend, why do you go on foot then?' 'Ah!' said he, 'I have this load to carry: to be sure it is silver, but it is\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"so heavy that I can't hold up my head, and you must know it hurts my shoulder sadly.' 'What do you say of making an exchange?' said the horseman. 'I will give you my horse, and you shall give me the silver; which will save you a great deal of trouble in\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"carrying such a heavy load about with you.' 'With all my heart,' said Hans: 'but as you are so kind to me, I must tell you one thing--you will have a weary task to draw that silver about with you.' However, the horseman got off, took the silver, helped\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Hans up, gave him the bridle into one hand and the whip into the other, and said, 'When you want to go very fast, smack your lips loudly together, and cry \\\\\\\"Jip!\\\\\\\"' Hans was delighted as he sat on the horse, drew himself up, squared his elbows, turned out\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"his toes, cracked his whip, and rode merrily off, one minute whistling a merry tune, and another singing, 'No care and no sorrow, A fig for the morrow! We'll laugh and be merry, Sing neigh down derry!' After a time he thought he should like to go a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"little faster, so he smacked his lips and cried 'Jip!' Away went the horse full gallop; and before Hans knew what he was about, he was thrown off, and lay on his back by the road-side. His horse would have ran off, if a shepherd who was coming by,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"driving a cow, had not stopped it. Hans soon came to himself, and got upon his legs again, sadly vexed, and said to the shepherd, 'This riding is no joke, when a man has the luck to get upon a beast like this that stumbles and flings him off as if it\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"would break his neck. However, I'm off now once for all: I like your cow now a great deal better than this smart beast that played me this trick, and has spoiled my best coat, you see, in this puddle; which, by the by, smells not very like a nosegay.\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"One can walk along at one's leisure behind that cow--keep good company, and have milk, butter, and cheese, every day, into the bargain. What would I give to have such a prize!' 'Well,' said the shepherd, 'if you are so fond of her, I will change my cow\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"for your horse; I like to do good to my neighbours, even though I lose by it myself.' 'Done!' said Hans, merrily. 'What a noble heart that good man has!' thought he. Then the shepherd jumped upon the horse, wished Hans and the cow good morning, and away\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"he rode. Hans brushed his coat, wiped his face and hands, rested a while, and then drove off his cow quietly, and thought his bargain a very lucky one. 'If I have only a piece of bread (and I certainly shall always be able to get that), I can,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"whenever I like, eat my butter and cheese with it; and when I am thirsty I can milk my cow and drink the milk: and what can I wish for more?' When he came to an inn, he halted, ate up all his bread, and gave away his last penny for a glass of beer.\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"When he had rested himself he set off again, driving his cow towards his mother's village. But the heat grew greater as soon as noon came on, till at last, as he found himself on a wide heath that would take him more than an hour to cross, he began to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"be so hot and parched that his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth. 'I can find a cure for this,' thought he; 'now I will milk my cow and quench my thirst': so he tied her to the stump of a tree, and held his leathern cap to milk into; but not a drop\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"was to be had. Who would have thought that this cow, which was to bring him milk and butter and cheese, was all that time utterly dry? Hans had not thought of looking to that. While he was trying his luck in milking, and managing the matter very\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"clumsily, the uneasy beast began to think him very troublesome; and at last gave him such a kick on the head as knocked him down; and there he lay a long while senseless. Luckily a butcher soon came by, driving a pig in a wheelbarrow.\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"'What is the matter with you, my man?' said the butcher, as he helped him up. Hans told him what had happened, how he was dry, and wanted to milk his cow, but found the cow was dry too. Then the butcher gave him a flask of ale, saying, 'There, drink\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and refresh yourself; your cow will give you no milk: don't you see she is an old beast, good for nothing but the slaughter-house?' 'Alas, alas!' said Hans, 'who would have thought it? What a shame to take my horse, and give me only a dry cow! If\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"I kill her, what will she be good for? I hate cow-beef; it is not tender enough for me. If it were a pig now--like that fat gentleman you are driving along at his ease--one could do something with it; it would at any rate make sausages.' 'Well,' said\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the butcher, 'I don't like to say no, when one is asked to do a kind, neighbourly thing. To please you I will change, and give you my fine fat pig for the cow.' 'Heaven reward you for your kindness and self-denial!' said Hans, as he gave the butcher the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"cow; and taking the pig off the wheel-barrow, drove it away, holding it by the string that was tied to its leg. So on he jogged, and all seemed now to go right with him: he had met with some misfortunes, to be sure; but he was now well repaid for\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"all. How could it be otherwise with such a travelling companion as he had at last got? The next man he met was a countryman carrying a fine white goose. The countryman stopped to ask what was o'clock; this led to further chat; and Hans told him all\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"his luck, how he had so many good bargains, and how all the world went gay and smiling with him. The countryman than began to tell his tale, and said he was going to take the goose to a christening. 'Feel,' said he, 'how heavy it is, and yet it is only\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"eight weeks old. Whoever roasts and eats it will find plenty of fat upon it, it has lived so well!' 'You're right,' said Hans, as he weighed it in his hand; 'but if you talk of fat, my pig is no trifle.' Meantime the countryman began to look grave, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"shook his head. 'Hark ye!' said he, 'my worthy friend, you seem a good sort of fellow, so I can't help doing you a kind turn. Your pig may get you into a scrape. In the village I just came from, the squire has had a pig stolen out of his sty. I was\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"dreadfully afraid when I saw you that you had got the squire's pig. If you have, and they catch you, it will be a bad job for you. The least they will do will be to throw you into the horse-pond. Can you swim?' Poor Hans was sadly frightened. 'Good\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"man,' cried he, 'pray get me out of this scrape. I know nothing of where the pig was either bred or born; but he may have been the squire's for aught I can tell: you know this country better than I do, take my pig and give me the goose.' 'I ought to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"have something into the bargain,' said the countryman; 'give a fat goose for a pig, indeed! 'Tis not everyone would do so much for you as that. However, I will not be hard upon you, as you are in trouble.' Then he took the string in his hand, and drove\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"off the pig by a side path; while Hans went on the way homewards free from care. 'After all,' thought he, 'that chap is pretty well taken in. I don't care whose pig it is, but wherever it came from it has been a very good friend to me. I have much the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"best of the bargain. First there will be a capital roast; then the fat will find me in goose-grease for six months; and then there are all the beautiful white feathers. I will put them into my pillow, and then I am sure I shall sleep soundly without\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"rocking. How happy my mother will be! Talk of a pig, indeed! Give me a fine fat goose.' As he came to the next village, he saw a scissor-grinder with his wheel, working and singing, 'O'er hill and o'er dale So happy I roam, Work light and live well, All\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the world is my home; Then who so blythe, so merry as I?' Hans stood looking on for a while, and at last said, 'You must be well off, master grinder! you seem so happy at your work.' 'Yes,' said the other, 'mine is a golden trade; a good grinder never\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"puts his hand into his pocket without finding money in it--but where did you get that beautiful goose?' 'I did not buy it, I gave a pig for it.' 'And where did you get the pig?' 'I gave a cow for it.' 'And the cow?' 'I gave a horse for it.' 'And the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"horse?' 'I gave a lump of silver as big as my head for it.' 'And the silver?' 'Oh! I worked hard for that seven long years.' 'You have thriven well in the world hitherto,' said the grinder, 'now if you could find money in your pocket whenever you put\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"your hand in it, your fortune would be made.' 'Very true: but how is that to be managed?' 'How? Why, you must turn grinder like myself,' said the other; 'you only want a grindstone; the rest will come of itself. Here is one that is but little the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"worse for wear: I would not ask more than the value of your goose for it--will you buy?' 'How can you ask?' said Hans; 'I should be the happiest man in the world, if I could have money whenever I put my hand in my pocket: what could I want more?\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"there's the goose.' 'Now,' said the grinder, as he gave him a common rough stone that lay by his side, 'this is a most capital stone; do but work it well enough, and you can make an old nail cut with it.' Hans took the stone, and went his way with a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"light heart: his eyes sparkled for joy, and he said to himself, 'Surely I must have been born in a lucky hour; everything I could want or wish for comes of itself. People are so kind; they seem really to think I do them a favour in letting them make me\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"rich, and giving me good bargains.' Meantime he began to be tired, and hungry too, for he had given away his last penny in his joy at getting the cow. At last he could go no farther, for the stone tired him sadly: and he dragged himself to the side of a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"river, that he might take a drink of water, and rest a while. So he laid the stone carefully by his side on the bank: but, as he stooped down to drink, he forgot it, pushed it a little, and down it rolled, plump into the stream. For a while he watched\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"it sinking in the deep clear water; then sprang up and danced for joy, and again fell upon his knees and thanked Heaven, with tears in his eyes, for its kindness in taking away his only plague, the ugly heavy stone. 'How happy am I!' cried he;\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"'nobody was ever so lucky as I.' Then up he got with a light heart, free from all his troubles, and walked on till he reached his mother's house, and told her how very easy the road to good luck was.\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

There were seven hundred of these cages hanging in the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"castle, and all with beautiful birds in them. Now there was once a maiden whose name was Jorinda. She was prettier than all the pretty girls that ever were seen before, and a shepherd lad, whose name was Jorindel, was very fond of her, and they\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"were soon to be married. One day they went to walk in the wood, that they might be alone; and Jorindel said, 'We must take care that we don't go too near to the fairy's castle.' It was a beautiful evening; the last rays of the setting sun shone bright\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"through the long stems of the trees upon the green underwood beneath, and the turtle-doves sang from the tall birches. Jorinda sat down to gaze upon the sun; Jorindel sat by her side; and both felt sad, they knew not why; but it seemed as if they were\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"to be parted from one another for ever. They had wandered a long way; and when they looked to see which way they should go home, they found themselves at a loss to know what path to take. The sun was setting fast, and already half of its circle had sunk\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"behind the hill: Jorindel on a sudden looked behind him, and saw through the bushes that they had, without knowing it, sat down close under the old walls of the castle. Then he shrank for fear, turned pale, and trembled. Jorinda was just singing, 'The\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"ring-dove sang from the willow spray, Well-a-day! Well-a-day! He mourn'd for the fate of his darling mate, Well-a-day!' when her song stopped suddenly. Jorindel turned to see the reason, and beheld his Jorinda changed into a nightingale,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"so that her song ended with a mournful _jug, jug_. An owl with fiery eyes flew three times round them, and three times screamed: 'Tu whu! Tu whu! Tu whu!' Jorindel could not move; he stood fixed as a stone, and could neither weep, nor\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"speak, nor stir hand or foot. And now the sun went quite down; the gloomy night came; the owl flew into a bush; and a moment after the old fairy came forth pale and meagre, with staring eyes, and a nose and chin that almost met one another. She mumbled\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"something to herself, seized the nightingale, and went away with it in her hand. Poor Jorindel saw the nightingale was gone--but what could he do? He could not speak, he could not move from the spot where he stood. At last the fairy came back and sang\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"with a hoarse voice: 'Till the prisoner is fast, And her doom is cast, There stay! Oh, stay! When the charm is around her, And the spell has bound her, Hie away! away!' On a sudden Jorindel found himself free. Then he fell on his knees before the fairy,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and prayed her to give him back his dear Jorinda: but she laughed at him, and said he should never see her again; then she went her way. He prayed, he wept, he sorrowed, but all in vain. 'Alas!' he said, 'what will become of me?' He could not go back to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"his own home, so he went to a strange village, and employed himself in keeping sheep. Many a time did he walk round and round as near to the hated castle as he dared go, but all in vain; he heard or saw nothing of Jorinda. At last he dreamt one night\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"that he found a beautiful purple flower, and that in the middle of it lay a costly pearl; and he dreamt that he plucked the flower, and went with it in his hand into the castle, and that everything he touched with it was disenchanted, and that there he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"found his Jorinda again. In the morning when he awoke, he began to search over hill and dale for this pretty flower; and eight long days he sought for it in vain: but on the ninth day, early in the morning, he found the beautiful purple flower; and in\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the middle of it was a large dewdrop, as big as a costly pearl. Then he plucked the flower, and set out and travelled day and night, till he came again to the castle. He walked nearer than a hundred paces to it, and yet he did not become fixed as\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"before, but found that he could go quite close up to the door. Jorindel was very glad indeed to see this. Then he touched the door with the flower, and it sprang open; so that he went in through the court, and listened when he heard so many birds\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"singing. At last he came to the chamber where the fairy sat, with the seven hundred birds singing in the seven hundred cages. When she saw Jorindel she was very angry, and screamed with rage; but she could not come within two yards of him, for the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"flower he held in his hand was his safeguard. He looked around at the birds, but alas! there were many, many nightingales, and how then should he find out which was his Jorinda? While he was thinking what to do, he saw the fairy had taken down one of\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the cages, and was making the best of her way off through the door. He ran or flew after her, touched the cage with the flower, and Jorinda stood before him, and threw her arms round his neck looking as beautiful as ever, as beautiful as when they\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"walked together in the wood. Then he touched all the other birds with the flower, so that they all took their old forms again; and he took Jorinda home, where they were married, and lived happily together many years: and so did a good many other\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"lads, whose maidens had been forced to sing in the old fairy's cages by themselves, much longer than they liked.\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

He had two richly laden ships then making a voyage upon the seas, in which he had embarked all his wealth, in the hope of making great\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"gains, when the news came that both were lost. Thus from being a rich man he became all at once so very poor that nothing was left to him but one small plot of land; and there he often went in an evening to take his walk, and ease his mind of a little\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"of his trouble. One day, as he was roaming along in a brown study, thinking with no great comfort on what he had been and what he now was, and was like to be, all on a sudden there stood before him a little, rough-looking, black dwarf. 'Prithee, friend,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"why so sorrowful?' said he to the merchant; 'what is it you take so deeply to heart?' 'If you would do me any good I would willingly tell you,' said the merchant. 'Who knows but I may?' said the little man: 'tell me what ails you, and perhaps you will\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"find I may be of some use.' Then the merchant told him how all his wealth was gone to the bottom of the sea, and how he had nothing left but that little plot of land. 'Oh, trouble not yourself about that,' said the dwarf; 'only undertake to bring me\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"here, twelve years hence, whatever meets you first on your going home, and I will give you as much as you please.' The merchant thought this was no great thing to ask; that it would most likely be his dog or his cat, or something of that sort, but\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"forgot his little boy Heinel; so he agreed to the bargain, and signed and sealed the bond to do what was asked of him. But as he drew near home, his little boy was so glad to see him that he crept behind him, and laid fast hold of his legs, and looked\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"up in his face and laughed. Then the father started, trembling with fear and horror, and saw what it was that he had bound himself to do; but as no gold was come, he made himself easy by thinking that it was only a joke that the dwarf was playing him,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and that, at any rate, when the money came, he should see the bearer, and would not take it in. About a month afterwards he went upstairs into a lumber-room to look for some old iron, that he might sell it and raise a little money; and there, instead of\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"his iron, he saw a large pile of gold lying on the floor. At the sight of this he was overjoyed, and forgetting all about his son, went into trade again, and became a richer merchant than before. Meantime little Heinel grew up, and as the end of the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"twelve years drew near the merchant began to call to mind his bond, and became very sad and thoughtful; so that care and sorrow were written upon his face. The boy one day asked what was the matter, but his father would not tell for some time; at last,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"however, he said that he had, without knowing it, sold him for gold to a little, ugly-looking, black dwarf, and that the twelve years were coming round when he must keep his word. Then Heinel said, 'Father, give yourself very little trouble about\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"that; I shall be too much for the little man.' When the time came, the father and son went out together to the place agreed upon: and the son drew a circle on the ground, and set himself and his father in the middle of it. The little black dwarf soon\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"came, and walked round and round about the circle, but could not find any way to get into it, and he either could not, or dared not, jump over it. At last the boy said to him. 'Have you anything to say to us, my friend, or what do you want?' Now Heinel\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"had found a friend in a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do; for this fairy knew what good luck was in store for him. 'Have you brought me what you said you would?' said the dwarf to the merchant. The old man held his tongue,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"but Heinel said again, 'What do you want here?' The dwarf said, 'I come to talk with your father, not with you.' 'You have cheated and taken in my father,' said the son; 'pray give him up his bond at once.' 'Fair and softly,' said the little old man;\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"'right is right; I have paid my money, and your father has had it, and spent it; so be so good as to let me have what I paid it for.' 'You must have my consent to that first,' said Heinel, 'so please to step in here, and let us talk it over.' The old\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"man grinned, and showed his teeth, as if he should have been very glad to get into the circle if he could. Then at last, after a long talk, they came to terms. Heinel agreed that his father must give him up, and that so far the dwarf should have his\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"way: but, on the other hand, the fairy had told Heinel what fortune was in store for him, if he followed his own course; and he did not choose to be given up to his hump-backed friend, who seemed so anxious for his company. So, to make a sort of drawn\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"battle of the matter, it was settled that Heinel should be put into an open boat, that lay on the sea-shore hard by; that the father should push him off with his own hand, and that he should thus be set adrift, and left to the bad or good luck of wind\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and weather. Then he took leave of his father, and set himself in the boat, but before it got far off a wave struck it, and it fell with one side low in the water, so the merchant thought that poor Heinel was lost, and went home very sorrowful, while\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the dwarf went his way, thinking that at any rate he had had his revenge. The boat, however, did not sink, for the good fairy took care of her friend, and soon raised the boat up again, and it went safely on. The young man sat safe within, till at\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"length it ran ashore upon an unknown land. As he jumped upon the shore he saw before him a beautiful castle but empty and dreary within, for it was enchanted. 'Here,' said he to himself, 'must I find the prize the good fairy told me of.' So he once\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"more searched the whole palace through, till at last he found a white snake, lying coiled up on a cushion in one of the chambers. Now the white snake was an enchanted princess; and she was very glad to see him, and said, 'Are you at last come to set me\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"free? Twelve long years have I waited here for the fairy to bring you hither as she promised, for you alone can save me. This night twelve men will come: their faces will be black, and they will be dressed in chain armour. They will ask what you do\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"here, but give no answer; and let them do what they will--beat, whip, pinch, prick, or torment you--bear all; only speak not a word, and at twelve o'clock they must go away. The second night twelve others will come: and the third night\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"twenty-four, who will even cut off your head; but at the twelfth hour of that night their power is gone, and I shall be free, and will come and bring you the Water of Life, and will wash you with it, and bring you back to life and health.' And all came\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"to pass as she had said; Heinel bore all, and spoke not a word; and the third night the princess came, and fell on his neck and kissed him. Joy and gladness burst forth throughout the castle, the wedding was celebrated, and he was crowned\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"king of the Golden Mountain. They lived together very happily, and the queen had a son. And thus eight years had passed over their heads, when the king thought of his father; and he began to long to see him once again. But the queen was\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"against his going, and said, 'I know well that misfortunes will come upon us if you go.' However, he gave her no rest till she agreed. At his going away she gave him a wishing-ring, and said, 'Take this ring, and put it on your finger; whatever you\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"wish it will bring you; only promise never to make use of it to bring me hence to your father's house.' Then he said he would do what she asked, and put the ring on his finger, and wished himself near the town where his father lived. Heinel found\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"himself at the gates in a moment; but the guards would not let him go in, because he was so strangely clad. So he went up to a neighbouring hill, where a shepherd dwelt, and borrowed his old frock, and thus passed unknown into the town. When he came to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"his father's house, he said he was his son; but the merchant would not believe him, and said he had had but one son, his poor Heinel, who he knew was long since dead: and as he was only dressed like a poor shepherd, he would not even give him anything\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"to eat. The king, however, still vowed that he was his son, and said, 'Is there no mark by which you would know me if I am really your son?' 'Yes,' said his mother, 'our Heinel had a mark like a raspberry on his right arm.' Then he showed them the mark,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and they knew that what he had said was true. He next told them how he was king of the Golden Mountain, and was married to a princess, and had a son seven years old. But the merchant said, 'that can never be true; he must be a fine king truly who\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"travels about in a shepherd's frock!' At this the son was vexed; and forgetting his word, turned his ring, and wished for his queen and son. In an instant they stood before him; but the queen wept, and said he had broken his word, and bad luck would\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"follow. He did all he could to soothe her, and she at last seemed to be appeased; but she was not so in truth, and was only thinking how she should punish him. One day he took her to walk with him out of the town, and showed her the spot where the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"boat was set adrift upon the wide waters. Then he sat himself down, and said, 'I am very much tired; sit by me, I will rest my head in your lap, and sleep a while.' As soon as he had fallen asleep, however, she drew the ring from his finger, and crept\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"softly away, and wished herself and her son at home in their kingdom. And when he awoke he found himself alone, and saw that the ring was gone from his finger. 'I can never go back to my father's house,' said he; 'they would say I am a sorcerer: I\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"will journey forth into the world, till I come again to my kingdom.' So saying he set out and travelled till he came to a hill, where three giants were sharing their father's goods; and as they saw him pass they cried out and said, 'Little men have\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"sharp wits; he shall part the goods between us.' Now there was a sword that cut off an enemy's head whenever the wearer gave the words, 'Heads off!'; a cloak that made the owner invisible, or gave him any form he pleased; and a pair of\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"boots that carried the wearer wherever he wished. Heinel said they must first let him try these wonderful things, then he might know how to set a value upon them. Then they gave him the cloak, and he wished himself a fly, and in a moment he was a fly.\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"'The cloak is very well,' said he: 'now give me the sword.' 'No,' said they; 'not unless you undertake not to say, \\\\\\\"Heads off!\\\\\\\" for if you do we are all dead men.' So they gave it him, charging him to try it on a tree. He next asked for the boots also;\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and the moment he had all three in his power, he wished himself at the Golden Mountain; and there he was at once. So the giants were left behind with no goods to share or quarrel about. As Heinel came near his castle he heard the sound of merry music;\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and the people around told him that his queen was about to marry another husband. Then he threw his cloak around him, and passed through the castle hall, and placed himself by the side of the queen, where no one saw him. But when\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"anything to eat was put upon her plate, he took it away and ate it himself; and when a glass of wine was handed to her, he took it and drank it; and thus, though they kept on giving her meat and drink, her plate and cup were always empty. Upon this,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"fear and remorse came over her, and she went into her chamber alone, and sat there weeping; and he followed her there. 'Alas!' said she to herself, 'was I not once set free? Why then does this enchantment still seem to bind me?' 'False and fickle\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"one!' said he. 'One indeed came who set thee free, and he is now near thee again; but how have you used him? Ought he to have had such treatment from thee?' Then he went out and sent away the company, and said the wedding was at an end, for that he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"was come back to the kingdom. But the princes, peers, and great men mocked at him. However, he would enter into no parley with them, but only asked them if they would go in peace or not. Then they turned upon him and tried to seize him; but he drew his\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"sword. 'Heads Off!' cried he; and with the word the traitors' heads fell before him, and Heinel was once more king of the Golden Mountain.\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

Once upon\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"a time the king held a great feast, and asked thither all her suitors; and they all sat in a row, ranged according to their rank--kings, and princes, and dukes, and earls, and counts, and barons, and knights. Then the princess came in, and as she\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"passed by them she had something spiteful to say to every one. The first was too fat: 'He's as round as a tub,' said she. The next was too tall: 'What a maypole!' said she. The next was too short: 'What a dumpling!' said she. The fourth was too pale,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and she called him 'Wallface.' The fifth was too red, so she called him 'Coxcomb.' The sixth was not straight enough; so she said he was like a green stick, that had been laid to dry over a baker's oven. And thus she had some joke to crack upon every\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"one: but she laughed more than all at a good king who was there. 'Look at him,' said she; 'his beard is like an old mop; he shall be called Grisly-beard.' So the king got the nickname of Grisly-beard. But the old king was very angry when he saw how his\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"daughter behaved, and how she ill-treated all his guests; and he vowed that, willing or unwilling, she should marry the first man, be he prince or beggar, that came to the door. Two days after there came by a travelling fiddler, who began to play\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"under the window and beg alms; and when the king heard him, he said, 'Let him come in.' So they brought in a dirty-looking fellow; and when he had sung before the king and the princess, he begged a boon. Then the king said, 'You have sung so well, that\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"I will give you my daughter for your wife.' The princess begged and prayed; but the king said, 'I have sworn to give you to the first comer, and I will keep my word.' So words and tears were of no avail; the parson was sent for, and she was married to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the fiddler. When this was over the king said, 'Now get ready to go--you must not stay here--you must travel on with your husband.' Then the fiddler went his way, and took her with him, and they soon came to a great wood. 'Pray,' said she, 'whose is\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"this wood?' 'It belongs to King Grisly-beard,' answered he; 'hadst thou taken him, all had been thine.' 'Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!' sighed she; 'would that I had married King Grisly-beard!' Next they came to some fine meadows. 'Whose are these\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"beautiful green meadows?' said she. 'They belong to King Grisly-beard, hadst thou taken him, they had all been thine.' 'Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!' said she; 'would that I had married King Grisly-beard!' Then they came to a great city. 'Whose is this\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"noble city?' said she. 'It belongs to King Grisly-beard; hadst thou taken him, it had all been thine.' 'Ah! wretch that I am!' sighed she; 'why did I not marry King Grisly-beard?' 'That is no business of mine,' said the fiddler: 'why should you wish for\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"another husband? Am not I good enough for you?' At last they came to a small cottage. 'What a paltry place!' said she; 'to whom does that little dirty hole belong?' Then the fiddler said, 'That is your and my house, where we are to live.' 'Where are\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"your servants?' cried she. 'What do we want with servants?' said he; 'you must do for yourself whatever is to be done. Now make the fire, and put on water and cook my supper, for I am very tired.' But the princess knew nothing of making fires and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"cooking, and the fiddler was forced to help her. When they had eaten a very scanty meal they went to bed; but the fiddler called her up very early in the morning to clean the house. Thus they lived for two days: and when they had eaten up all there\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"was in the cottage, the man said, 'Wife, we can't go on thus, spending money and earning nothing. You must learn to weave baskets.' Then he went out and cut willows, and brought them home, and she began to weave; but it made her fingers very sore. 'I\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"see this work won't do,' said he: 'try and spin; perhaps you will do that better.' So she sat down and tried to spin; but the threads cut her tender fingers till the blood ran. 'See now,' said the fiddler, 'you are good for nothing; you can do no work:\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"what a bargain I have got! However, I'll try and set up a trade in pots and pans, and you shall stand in the market and sell them.' 'Alas!' sighed she, 'if any of my father's court should pass by and see me standing in the market, how they will laugh at\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"me!' But her husband did not care for that, and said she must work, if she did not wish to die of hunger. At first the trade went well; for many people, seeing such a beautiful woman, went to buy her wares, and paid their money without thinking of\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"taking away the goods. They lived on this as long as it lasted; and then her husband bought a fresh lot of ware, and she sat herself down with it in the corner of the market; but a drunken soldier soon came by, and rode his horse against her stall, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"broke all her goods into a thousand pieces. Then she began to cry, and knew not what to do. 'Ah! what will become of me?' said she; 'what will my husband say?' So she ran home and told him all. 'Who would have thought you would have been so silly,' said\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"he, 'as to put an earthenware stall in the corner of the market, where everybody passes? but let us have no more crying; I see you are not fit for this sort of work, so I have been to the king's palace, and asked if they did not want a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"kitchen-maid; and they say they will take you, and there you will have plenty to eat.' Thus the princess became a kitchen-maid, and helped the cook to do all the dirtiest work; but she was allowed to carry home some of the meat that was left, and on\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"this they lived. She had not been there long before she heard that the king's eldest son was passing by, going to be married; and she went to one of the windows and looked out. Everything was ready, and all the pomp and brightness of the court was\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"there. Then she bitterly grieved for the pride and folly which had brought her so low. And the servants gave her some of the rich meats, which she put into her basket to take home. All on a sudden, as she was going out, in came the king's son in\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"golden clothes; and when he saw a beautiful woman at the door, he took her by the hand, and said she should be his partner in the dance; but she trembled for fear, for she saw that it was King Grisly-beard, who was making sport\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"of her. However, he kept fast hold, and led her in; and the cover of the basket came off, so that the meats in it fell about. Then everybody laughed and jeered at her; and she was so abashed, that she wished herself a thousand feet deep in the earth.\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"She sprang to the door to run away; but on the steps King Grisly-beard overtook her, and brought her back and said, 'Fear me not! I am the fiddler who has lived with you in the hut. I brought you there because I really loved you. I am also the soldier\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"that overset your stall. I have done all this only to cure you of your silly pride, and to show you the folly of your ill-treatment of me. Now all is over: you have learnt wisdom, and it is time to hold our marriage feast.' Then the chamberlains\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"came and brought her the most beautiful robes; and her father and his whole court were there already, and welcomed her home on her marriage. Joy was in every face and every heart. The feast was grand; they danced and sang; all were merry; and I\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"only wish that you and I had been of the party.\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

The eldest wished for pearls; the second for jewels; but the third, who was called Lily, said,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"'Dear father, bring me a rose.' Now it was no easy task to find a rose, for it was the middle of winter; yet as she was his prettiest daughter, and was very fond of flowers, her father said he would try what he could do. So he kissed all three, and bid\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"them goodbye. And when the time came for him to go home, he had bought pearls and jewels for the two eldest, but he had sought everywhere in vain for the rose; and when he went into any garden and asked for such a thing, the people laughed at him, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"asked him whether he thought roses grew in snow. This grieved him very much, for Lily was his dearest child; and as he was journeying home, thinking what he should bring her, he came to a fine castle; and around the castle was a garden, in one half of\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"which it seemed to be summer-time and in the other half winter. On one side the finest flowers were in full bloom, and on the other everything looked dreary and buried in the snow.

This done, they were riding away well pleased, when up sprang a fierce lion, and roared out, 'Whoever has stolen my roses shall be eaten up alive!'\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Then the man said, 'I knew not that the garden belonged to you; can nothing save my life?' 'No!' said the lion, 'nothing, unless you undertake to give me whatever meets you on your return home; if you agree to this, I will give you your life, and the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"rose too for your daughter.' But the man was unwilling to do so and said, 'It may be my youngest daughter, who loves me most, and always runs to meet me when I go home.' Then the servant was greatly frightened, and said, 'It may perhaps be only a cat or\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"a dog.' And at last the man yielded with a heavy heart, and took the rose; and said he would give the lion whatever should meet him first on his return. And as he came near home, it was Lily, his youngest and dearest daughter, that met him; she came\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"running, and kissed him, and welcomed him home; and when she saw that he had brought her the rose, she was still more glad. But her father began to be very sorrowful, and to weep, saying, 'Alas, my dearest child! I have bought this flower at a high\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"price, for I have said I would give you to a wild lion; and when he has you, he will tear you in pieces, and eat you.' Then he told her all that had happened, and said she should not go, let what would happen. But she comforted him, and said, 'Dear\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"father, the word you have given must be kept; I will go to the lion, and soothe him: perhaps he will let me come safe home again.' The next morning she asked the way she was to go, and took leave of her father, and went forth with a bold heart into the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"wood. But the lion was an enchanted prince. By day he and all his court were lions, but in the evening they took their right forms again. And when Lily came to the castle, he welcomed her so courteously that she agreed to marry him. The\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"wedding-feast was held, and they lived happily together a long time. The prince was only to be seen as soon as evening came, and then he held his court; but every morning he left his bride, and went away by himself, she knew not whither, till the night\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"came again. After some time he said to her, 'Tomorrow there will be a great feast in your father's house, for your eldest sister is to be married; and if you wish to go and visit her my lions shall lead you thither.' Then she rejoiced much at the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"thoughts of seeing her father once more, and set out with the lions; and everyone was overjoyed to see her, for they had thought her dead long since. But she told them how happy she was, and stayed till the feast was over, and then\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"went back to the wood. Her second sister was soon after married, and when Lily was asked to go to the wedding, she said to the prince, 'I will not go alone this time--you must go with me.' But he would not, and said that it would be a very hazardous\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"thing; for if the least ray of the torch-light should fall upon him his enchantment would become still worse, for he should be changed into a dove, and be forced to wander about the world for seven long years. However, she gave him no rest,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and said she would take care no light should fall upon him. So at last they set out together, and took with them their little child; and she chose a large hall with thick walls for him to sit in while the wedding-torches were lighted; but, unluckily,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"no one saw that there was a crack in the door. Then the wedding was held with great pomp, but as the train came from the church, and passed with the torches before the hall, a very small ray of light fell upon the prince. In a moment he disappeared, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"when his wife came in and looked for him, she found only a white dove; and it said to her, 'Seven years must I fly up and down over the face of the earth, but every now and then I will let fall a white feather, that will show you the way I am going;\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"follow it, and at last you may overtake and set me free.' This said, he flew out at the door, and poor Lily followed; and every now and then a white feather fell, and showed her the way she was to journey. Thus she went roving on through the wide\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"world, and looked neither to the right hand nor to the left, nor took any rest, for seven years. Then she began to be glad, and thought to herself that the time was fast coming when all her troubles should end; yet repose was still far off, for one day\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"as she was travelling on she missed the white feather, and when she lifted up her eyes she could nowhere see the dove. 'Now,' thought she to herself, 'no aid of man can be of use to me.' So she went to the sun and said, 'Thou shinest everywhere, on\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the hill's top and the valley's depth--hast thou anywhere seen my white dove?' 'No,' said the sun, 'I have not seen it; but I will give thee a casket--open it when thy hour of need comes.' So she thanked the sun, and went on her way till eventide; and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"when the moon arose, she cried unto it, and said, 'Thou shinest through the night, over field and grove--hast thou nowhere seen my white dove?' 'No,' said the moon, 'I cannot help thee but I will give thee an egg--break it when need comes.' Then\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"she thanked the moon, and went on till the night-wind blew; and she raised up her voice to it, and said, 'Thou blowest through every tree and under every leaf--hast thou not seen my white dove?' 'No,' said the night-wind, 'but I will ask three other\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"winds; perhaps they have seen it.' Then the east wind and the west wind came, and said they too had not seen it, but the south wind said, 'I have seen the white dove--he has fled to the Red Sea, and is changed once more into a lion, for the seven years\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"are passed away, and there he is fighting with a dragon; and the dragon is an enchanted princess, who seeks to separate him from you.' Then the night-wind said, 'I will give thee counsel. Go to the Red Sea; on the right shore stand many\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"rods--count them, and when thou comest to the eleventh, break it off, and smite the dragon with it; and so the lion will have the victory, and both of them will appear to you in their own forms. Then look round and thou wilt see a griffin,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"winged like bird, sitting by the Red Sea; jump on to his back with thy beloved one as quickly as possible, and he will carry you over the waters to your home. I will also give thee this nut,' continued the night-wind. 'When you are half-way over, throw\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"it down, and out of the waters will immediately spring up a high nut-tree on which the griffin will be able to rest, otherwise he would not have the strength to bear you the whole way; if, therefore, thou dost forget to throw down the nut, he will let\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"you both fall into the sea.' So our poor wanderer went forth, and found all as the night-wind had said; and she plucked the eleventh rod, and smote the dragon, and the lion forthwith became a prince, and the dragon a princess again. But no sooner was\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the princess released from the spell, than she seized the prince by the arm and sprang on to the griffin's back, and went off carrying the prince away with her. Thus the unhappy traveller was again forsaken and forlorn; but she took heart and said, 'As\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"far as the wind blows, and so long as the cock crows, I will journey on, till I find him once again.' She went on for a long, long way, till at length she came to the castle whither the princess had carried the prince; and there was a feast got ready,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and she heard that the wedding was about to be held. 'Heaven aid me now!' said she; and she took the casket that the sun had given her, and found that within it lay a dress as dazzling as the sun itself. So she put it on, and went into the palace, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"all the people gazed upon her; and the dress pleased the bride so much that she asked whether it was to be sold. 'Not for gold and silver.' said she, 'but for flesh and blood.' The princess asked what she meant, and she said, 'Let me speak with the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"bridegroom this night in his chamber, and I will give thee the dress.' At last the princess agreed, but she told her chamberlain to give the prince a sleeping draught, that he might not hear or see her. When evening came, and the prince had fallen\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"asleep, she was led into his chamber, and she sat herself down at his feet, and said: 'I have followed thee seven years. I have been to the sun, the moon, and the night-wind, to seek thee, and at last I have helped thee to overcome the dragon. Wilt thou\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"then forget me quite?' But the prince all the time slept so soundly, that her voice only passed over him, and seemed like the whistling of the wind among the fir-trees. Then poor Lily was led away, and forced to give up the golden dress; and when she\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"saw that there was no help for her, she went out into a meadow, and sat herself down and wept. But as she sat she bethought herself of the egg that the moon had given her; and when she broke it, there ran out a hen and twelve chickens\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"of pure gold, that played about, and then nestled under the old one's wings, so as to form the most beautiful sight in the world. And she rose up and drove them before her, till the bride saw them from her window, and was so pleased that she came forth\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and asked her if she would sell the brood. 'Not for gold or silver, but for flesh and blood: let me again this evening speak with the bridegroom in his chamber, and I will give thee the whole brood.' Then the princess thought to betray her as\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"before, and agreed to what she asked: but when the prince went to his chamber he asked the chamberlain why the wind had whistled so in the night. And the chamberlain told him all--how he had given him a sleeping draught, and how a poor maiden had\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"come and spoken to him in his chamber, and was to come again that night. Then the prince took care to throw away the sleeping draught; and when Lily came and began again to tell him what woes had befallen her, and how faithful and true to him she had\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"been, he knew his beloved wife's voice, and sprang up, and said, 'You have awakened me as from a dream, for the strange princess had thrown a spell around me, so that I had altogether forgotten you; but Heaven hath sent you to me in a lucky\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"hour.' And they stole away out of the palace by night unawares, and seated themselves on the griffin, who flew back with them over the Red Sea.

He had not even so much as a cow, and still less money to buy one, and yet he and his wife did so wish to have one.\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"One day he said to her: 'Listen, I have a good idea, there is our gossip the carpenter, he shall make us a wooden calf, and paint it brown, so that it looks like any other, and in time it will certainly get big and be a cow.' the woman also liked the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"idea, and their gossip the carpenter cut and planed the calf, and painted it as it ought to be, and made it with its head hanging down as if it were eating. Next morning when the cows were being driven out, the little peasant called the cow-herd in and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"said: 'Look, I have a little calf there, but it is still small and has to be carried.' The cow-herd said: 'All right,' and took it in his arms and carried it to the pasture, and set it among the grass. The little calf always remained standing like one\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"which was eating, and the cow-herd said: 'It will soon run by itself, just look how it eats already!' At night when he was going to drive the herd home again, he said to the calf: 'If you can stand there and eat your fill, you can also go on your four\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"legs; I don't care to drag you home again in my arms.' But the little peasant stood at his door, and waited for his little calf, and when the cow-herd drove the cows through the village, and the calf was missing, he inquired where it was. The\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"cow-herd answered: 'It is still standing out there eating. It would not stop and come with us.' But the little peasant said: 'Oh, but I must have my beast back again.' Then they went back to the meadow together, but someone had stolen the calf, and it\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"was gone. The cow-herd said: 'It must have run away.' The peasant, however, said: 'Don't tell me that,' and led the cow-herd before the mayor, who for his carelessness condemned him to give the peasant a cow for the calf which had run away. And now\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the little peasant and his wife had the cow for which they had so long wished, and they were heartily glad, but they had no food for it, and could give it nothing to eat, so it soon had to be killed. They salted the flesh, and the peasant went into the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"town and wanted to sell the skin there, so that he might buy a new calf with the proceeds. On the way he passed by a mill, and there sat a raven with broken wings, and out of pity he took him and wrapped him in the skin. But as the weather grew so\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"bad and there was a storm of rain and wind, he could go no farther, and turned back to the mill and begged for shelter. The miller's wife was alone in the house, and said to the peasant: 'Lay yourself on the straw there,' and gave him a slice of\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"bread and cheese. The peasant ate it, and lay down with his skin beside him, and the woman thought: 'He is tired and has gone to sleep.' In the meantime came the parson; the miller's wife received him well, and said: 'My husband is out, so we will have\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"a feast.' The peasant listened, and when he heard them talk about feasting he was vexed that he had been forced to make shift with a slice of bread and cheese. Then the woman served up four different things, roast meat, salad, cakes, and wine.\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Just as they were about to sit down and eat, there was a knocking outside. The woman said: 'Oh, heavens! It is my husband!' she quickly hid the roast meat inside the tiled stove, the wine under the pillow, the salad on the bed, the cakes under it, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the parson in the closet on the porch. Then she opened the door for her husband, and said: 'Thank heaven, you are back again! There is such a storm, it looks as if the world were coming to an end.' The miller saw the peasant lying on the straw, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"asked, 'What is that fellow doing there?' 'Ah,' said the wife, 'the poor knave came in the storm and rain, and begged for shelter, so I gave him a bit of bread and cheese, and showed him where the straw was.' The man said: 'I have no objection, but be\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"quick and get me something to eat.' The woman said: 'But I have nothing but bread and cheese.' 'I am contented with anything,' replied the husband, 'so far as I am concerned, bread and cheese will do,' and looked at the peasant and said: 'Come and eat\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"some more with me.' The peasant did not require to be invited twice, but got up and ate. After this the miller saw the skin in which the raven was, lying on the ground, and asked: 'What have you there?' The peasant answered: 'I have a soothsayer inside\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"it.' 'Can he foretell anything to me?' said the miller. 'Why not?' answered the peasant: 'but he only says four things, and the fifth he keeps to himself.' The miller was curious, and said: 'Let him foretell something for once.' Then the peasant pinched\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the raven's head, so that he croaked and made a noise like krr, krr. The miller said: 'What did he say?' The peasant answered: 'In the first place, he says that there is some wine hidden under the pillow.' 'Bless me!' cried the miller, and went there\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and found the wine. 'Now go on,' said he. The peasant made the raven croak again, and said: 'In the second place, he says that there is some roast meat in the tiled stove.' 'Upon my word!' cried the miller, and went thither, and found the roast meat.\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"The peasant made the raven prophesy still more, and said: 'Thirdly, he says that there is some salad on the bed.' 'That would be a fine thing!' cried the miller, and went there and found the salad. At last the peasant pinched the raven once more till he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"croaked, and said: 'Fourthly, he says that there are some cakes under the bed.' 'That would be a fine thing!' cried the miller, and looked there, and found the cakes. And now the two sat down to the table together, but the miller's wife was frightened\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"to death, and went to bed and took all the keys with her. The miller would have liked much to know the fifth, but the little peasant said: 'First, we will quickly eat the four things, for the fifth is something bad.' So they ate, and after that they\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"bargained how much the miller was to give for the fifth prophecy, until they agreed on three hundred talers. Then the peasant once more pinched the raven's head till he croaked loudly. The miller asked: 'What did he say?' The peasant replied: 'He says\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"that the Devil is hiding outside there in the closet on the porch.' The miller said: 'The Devil must go out,' and opened the house-door; then the woman was forced to give up the keys, and the peasant unlocked the closet. The parson ran out as fast as he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"could, and the miller said: 'It was true; I saw the black rascal with my own eyes.' The peasant, however, made off next morning by daybreak with the three hundred talers. At home the small peasant gradually launched out; he built a beautiful\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"house, and the peasants said: 'The small peasant has certainly been to the place where golden snow falls, and people carry the gold home in shovels.' Then the small peasant was brought before the mayor, and bidden to say from whence\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"his wealth came. He answered: 'I sold my cow's skin in the town, for three hundred talers.' When the peasants heard that, they too wished to enjoy this great profit, and ran home, killed all their cows, and stripped off their skins in order to sell\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"them in the town to the greatest advantage. The mayor, however, said: 'But my servant must go first.' When she came to the merchant in the town, he did not give her more than two talers for a skin, and when the others came, he did not give them so much,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and said: 'What can I do with all these skins?' Then the peasants were vexed that the small peasant should have thus outwitted them, wanted to take vengeance on him, and accused him of this treachery before the major. The innocent little\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"peasant was unanimously sentenced to death, and was to be rolled into the water, in a barrel pierced full of holes. He was led forth, and a priest was brought who was to say a mass for his soul. The others were all obliged to retire to a distance, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"when the peasant looked at the priest, he recognized the man who had been with the miller's wife. He said to him: 'I set you free from the closet, set me free from the barrel.' At this same moment up came, with a flock of sheep, the very shepherd whom\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the peasant knew had long been wishing to be mayor, so he cried with all his might: 'No, I will not do it; if the whole world insists on it, I will not do it!' The shepherd hearing that, came up to him, and asked: 'What are you about? What is it that\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"you will not do?' The peasant said: 'They want to make me mayor, if I will but put myself in the barrel, but I will not do it.' The shepherd said: 'If nothing more than that is needful in order to be mayor, I would get into the barrel at once.' The\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"peasant said: 'If you will get in, you will be mayor.' The shepherd was willing, and got in, and the peasant shut the top down on him; then he took the shepherd's flock for himself, and drove it away. The parson went to the crowd, and declared that the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"mass had been said. Then they came and rolled the barrel towards the water. When the barrel began to roll, the shepherd cried: 'I am quite willing to be mayor.' They believed no otherwise than that it was the peasant who was saying this, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"answered: 'That is what we intend, but first you shall look about you a little down below there,' and they rolled the barrel down into the water. After that the peasants went home, and as they were entering the village, the small peasant also came\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"quietly in, driving a flock of sheep and looking quite contented. Then the peasants were astonished, and said: 'Peasant, from whence do you come? Have you come out of the water?' 'Yes, truly,' replied the peasant, 'I sank deep, deep down,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"until at last I got to the bottom; I pushed the bottom out of the barrel, and crept out, and there were pretty meadows on which a number of lambs were feeding, and from thence I brought this flock away with me.' Said the peasants: 'Are there any more\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"there?' 'Oh, yes,' said he, 'more than I could want.' Then the peasants made up their minds that they too would fetch some sheep for themselves, a flock apiece, but the mayor said: 'I come first.' So they went to the water together, and just then there\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"were some of the small fleecy clouds in the blue sky, which are called little lambs, and they were reflected in the water, whereupon the peasants cried: 'We already see the sheep down below!' The mayor pressed forward and said: 'I will go down first,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and look about me, and if things promise well I'll call you.' So he jumped in; splash! went the water; it sounded as if he were calling them, and the whole crowd plunged in after him as one man. Then the entire village was dead, and the small peasant,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"as sole heir, became a rich man.\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

Once she gave her a little cap of red velvet, which\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"suited her so well that she would never wear anything else; so she was always called 'Little Red-Cap.' One day her mother said to her: 'Come, Little Red-Cap, here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine; take them to your grandmother, she\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"is ill and weak, and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot, and when you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path, or you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will get nothing; and when you go into\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"her room, don't forget to say, \\\\\\\"Good morning\\\\\\\", and don't peep into every corner before you do it.' 'I will take great care,' said Little Red-Cap to her mother, and gave her hand on it. The grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"village, and just as Little Red-Cap entered the wood, a wolf met her. Red-Cap did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of him. 'Good day, Little Red-Cap,' said he. 'Thank you kindly, wolf.' 'Whither away so early, Little\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Red-Cap?' 'To my grandmother's.' 'What have you got in your apron?' 'Cake and wine; yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to have something good, to make her stronger.' 'Where does your grandmother live, Little Red-Cap?' 'A\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"good quarter of a league farther on in the wood; her house stands under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below; you surely must know it,' replied Little Red-Cap. The wolf thought to himself: 'What a tender young\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"creature! what a nice plump mouthful--she will be better to eat than the old woman. I must act craftily, so as to catch both.' So he walked for a short time by the side of Little Red-Cap, and then he said: 'See, Little Red-Cap, how pretty the flowers\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"are about here--why do you not look round? I believe, too, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing; you walk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else out here in the wood is merry.' Little Red-Cap raised\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere, she thought: 'Suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay; that would please her too. It is so early\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"in the day that I shall still get there in good time'; and so she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers. And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a still prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"deeper into the wood. Meanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother's house and knocked at the door. 'Who is there?' 'Little Red-Cap,' replied the wolf. 'She is bringing cake and wine; open the door.' 'Lift the latch,' called out the grandmother,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"'I am too weak, and cannot get up.' The wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without saying a word he went straight to the grandmother's bed, and devoured her. Then he put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap laid himself in bed and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"drew the curtains. Little Red-Cap, however, had been running about picking flowers, and when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she remembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to her. She was surprised to find\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the cottage-door standing open, and when she went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to herself: 'Oh dear! how uneasy I feel today, and at other times I like being with grandmother so much.' She called out: 'Good morning,'\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"but received no answer; so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains. There lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and looking very strange. 'Oh! grandmother,' she said, 'what big ears you have!' 'The better to hear you with,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"my child,' was the reply. 'But, grandmother, what big eyes you have!' she said. 'The better to see you with, my dear.' 'But, grandmother, what large hands you have!' 'The better to hug you with.' 'Oh! but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"you have!' 'The better to eat you with!' And scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of bed and swallowed up Red-Cap. When the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in the bed, fell asleep and began to snore\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"very loud. The huntsman was just passing the house, and thought to himself: 'How the old woman is snoring! I must just see if she wants anything.' So he went into the room, and when he came to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in it. 'Do I find\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"you here, you old sinner!' said he. 'I have long sought you!' Then just as he was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did not fire, but took a pair of\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"scissors, and began to cut open the stomach of the sleeping wolf. When he had made two snips, he saw the little Red-Cap shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl sprang out, crying: 'Ah, how frightened I have been! How dark it\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"was inside the wolf'; and after that the aged grandmother came out alive also, but scarcely able to breathe. Red-Cap, however, quickly fetched great stones with which they filled the wolf's belly, and when he awoke, he wanted to run away, but the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"stones were so heavy that he collapsed at once, and fell dead. Then all three were delighted. The huntsman drew off the wolf's skin and went home with it; the grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which Red-Cap had brought, and revived, but\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Red-Cap thought to herself: 'As long as I live, I will never by myself leave the path, to run into the wood, when my mother has forbidden me to do so.' It also related that once when Red-Cap was again taking cakes to the old grandmother, another wolf\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"spoke to her, and tried to entice her from the path. Red-Cap, however, was on her guard, and went straight forward on her way, and told her grandmother that she had met the wolf, and that he had said 'good morning' to her, but with such\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"a wicked look in his eyes, that if they had not been on the public road she was certain he would have eaten her up. 'Well,' said the grandmother, 'we will shut the door, that he may not come in.' Soon afterwards the wolf knocked, and cried: 'Open the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"door, grandmother, I am Little Red-Cap, and am bringing you some cakes.' But they did not speak, or open the door, so the grey-beard stole twice or thrice round the house, and at last jumped on the roof, intending to wait until Red-Cap went home in the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"evening, and then to steal after her and devour her in the darkness. But the grandmother saw what was in his thoughts. In front of the house was a great stone trough, so she said to the child: 'Take the pail, Red-Cap; I made some sausages\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"yesterday, so carry the water in which I boiled them to the trough.' Red-Cap carried until the great trough was quite full. Then the smell of the sausages reached the wolf, and he sniffed and peeped down, and at last stretched out his neck so far that\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"he could no longer keep his footing and began to slip, and slipped down from the roof straight into the great trough, and was drowned. But Red-Cap went joyously home, and no one ever did anything to harm her again.\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

At last it came into the man's head that he would not go on thus without pay any longer; so he went to his master, and said, 'I\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"have worked hard for you a long time, I will trust to you to give me what I deserve to have for my trouble.' The farmer was a sad miser, and knew that his man was very simple-hearted; so he took out threepence, and gave him for every year's service a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"penny. The poor fellow thought it was a great deal of money to have, and said to himself, 'Why should I work hard, and live here on bad fare any longer? I can now travel into the wide world, and make myself merry.' With that he put his money into his\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"purse, and set out, roaming over hill and valley. As he jogged along over the fields, singing and dancing, a little dwarf met him, and asked him what made him so merry. 'Why, what should make me down-hearted?' said he; 'I am sound in health and rich in\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"purse, what should I care for? I have saved up my three years' earnings and have it all safe in my pocket.' 'How much may it come to?' said the little man. 'Full threepence,' replied the countryman. 'I wish you would give them to me,' said the other; 'I\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"am very poor.' Then the man pitied him, and gave him all he had; and the little dwarf said in return, 'As you have such a kind honest heart, I will grant you three wishes--one for every penny; so choose whatever you like.' Then the countryman\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"rejoiced at his good luck, and said, 'I like many things better than money: first, I will have a bow that will bring down everything I shoot at; secondly, a fiddle that will set everyone dancing that hears me play upon it; and thirdly, I should like\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"that everyone should grant what I ask.' The dwarf said he should have his three wishes; so he gave him the bow and fiddle, and went his way. Our honest friend journeyed on his way too; and if he was merry before, he was now ten times more so. He had not\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"gone far before he met an old miser: close by them stood a tree, and on the topmost twig sat a thrush singing away most joyfully. 'Oh, what a pretty bird!' said the miser; 'I would give a great deal of money to have such a one.' 'If that's all,' said\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the countryman, 'I will soon bring it down.' Then he took up his bow, and down fell the thrush into the bushes at the foot of the tree. The miser crept into the bush to find it; but directly he had got into the middle, his companion took up his fiddle\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and played away, and the miser began to dance and spring about, capering higher and higher in the air. The thorns soon began to tear his clothes till they all hung in rags about him, and he himself was all scratched and wounded, so that\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the blood ran down. 'Oh, for heaven's sake!' cried the miser, 'Master! master! pray let the fiddle alone. What have I done to deserve this?' 'Thou hast shaved many a poor soul close enough,' said the other; 'thou art only meeting thy\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"reward': so he played up another tune. Then the miser began to beg and promise, and offered money for his liberty; but he did not come up to the musician's price for some time, and he danced him along brisker and brisker, and the miser bid higher and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"higher, till at last he offered a round hundred of florins that he had in his purse, and had just gained by cheating some poor fellow. When the countryman saw so much money, he said, 'I will agree to your proposal.' So he took the purse, put up his\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"fiddle, and travelled on very pleased with his bargain. Meanwhile the miser crept out of the bush half-naked and in a piteous plight, and began to ponder how he should take his revenge, and serve his late companion some trick. At last he went to the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"judge, and complained that a rascal had robbed him of his money, and beaten him into the bargain; and that the fellow who did it carried a bow at his back and a fiddle hung round his neck. Then the judge sent out his officers to bring up the accused\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"wherever they should find him; and he was soon caught and brought up to be tried. The miser began to tell his tale, and said he had been robbed of his money. 'No, you gave it me for playing a tune to you.' said the countryman; but the judge told him\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"that was not likely, and cut the matter short by ordering him off to the gallows. So away he was taken; but as he stood on the steps he said, 'My Lord Judge, grant me one last request.' 'Anything but thy life,' replied the other. 'No,' said he, 'I do\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"not ask my life; only to let me play upon my fiddle for the last time.' The miser cried out, 'Oh, no! no! for heaven's sake don't listen to him! don't listen to him!' But the judge said, 'It is only this once, he will soon have done.' The fact was, he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"could not refuse the request, on account of the dwarf's third gift. Then the miser said, 'Bind me fast, bind me fast, for pity's sake.' But the countryman seized his fiddle, and struck up a tune, and at the first note judge, clerks, and jailer were in\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"motion; all began capering, and no one could hold the miser. At the second note the hangman let his prisoner go, and danced also, and by the time he had played the first bar of the tune, all were dancing together--judge, court, and miser, and all the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"people who had followed to look on. At first the thing was merry and pleasant enough; but when it had gone on a while, and there seemed to be no end of playing or dancing, they began to cry out, and beg him to leave off; but he stopped not a whit the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"more for their entreaties, till the judge not only gave him his life, but promised to return him the hundred florins. Then he called to the miser, and said, 'Tell us now, you vagabond, where you got that gold, or I shall play on for your amusement\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"only,' 'I stole it,' said the miser in the presence of all the people; 'I acknowledge that I stole it, and that you earned it fairly.'

So she shook the tree, and the apples came falling down upon her like rain; but she continued shaking until there\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"was not a single apple left upon it. Then she carefully gathered the apples together in a heap and walked on again. The next thing she came to was a little house, and there she saw an old woman looking out, with such large teeth, that she was terrified,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and turned to run away. But the old woman called after her, 'What are you afraid of, dear child? Stay with me; if you will do the work of my house properly for me, I will make you very happy.

The old woman spoke so kindly, that the girl summoned up courage and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"agreed to enter into her service. She took care to do everything according to the old woman's bidding and every time she made the bed she shook it with all her might, so that the feathers flew about like so many snowflakes. The old woman was as\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"good as her word: she never spoke angrily to her, and gave her roast and boiled meats every day. So she stayed on with Mother Holle for some time, and then she began to grow unhappy. She could not at first tell why she felt sad, but she became\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"conscious at last of great longing to go home; then she knew she was homesick, although she was a thousand times better off with Mother Holle than with her mother and sister. After waiting awhile, she went to Mother Holle and said, 'I am so\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"homesick, that I cannot stay with you any longer, for although I am so happy here, I must return to my own people.' Then Mother Holle said, 'I am pleased that you should want to go back to your own people, and as you have served me\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"so well and faithfully, I will take you home myself.' Thereupon she led the girl by the hand up to a broad gateway. The gate was opened, and as the girl passed through, a shower of gold fell upon her, and the gold clung to her, so that she\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"was covered with it from head to foot. 'That is a reward for your industry,' said Mother Holle, and as she spoke she handed her the spindle which she had dropped into the well. The gate was then closed, and the girl found herself back in the old\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"world close to her mother's house. As she entered the courtyard, the cock who was perched on the well, called out: 'Cock-a-doodle-doo! Your golden daughter's come back to you.'

So she made the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"sister go and sit by the well and spin, and the girl pricked her finger and thrust her hand into a thorn-bush, so that she might drop some blood on to the spindle; then she threw it into the well, and jumped in herself. Like her sister she awoke\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"in the beautiful meadow, and walked over it till she came to the oven. 'Take us out, take us out, or alas! we shall be burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long ago,' cried the loaves as before. But the lazy girl answered, 'Do you think I am going\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"to dirty my hands for you?' and walked on. Presently she came to the apple-tree. 'Shake me, shake me, I pray; my apples, one and all, are ripe,' it cried. But she only answered, 'A nice thing to ask me to do, one of the apples might fall on my head,'\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and passed on. At last she came to Mother Holle's house, and as she had heard all about the large teeth from her sister, she was not afraid of them, and engaged herself without delay to the old woman. The first day she was very obedient and industrious,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and exerted herself to please Mother Holle, for she thought of the gold she should get in return. The next day, however, she began to dawdle over her work, and the third day she was more idle still; then she began to lie in bed in the mornings\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and refused to get up.

For a long time all went well; they lived in great comfort, and prospered so far as to be able to add considerably to their stores. The bird's\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"duty was to fly daily into the wood and bring in fuel; the mouse fetched the water, and the sausage saw to the cooking. When people are too well off they always begin to long for something new. And so it came to pass, that the bird, while out one day,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"met a fellow bird, to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of his household arrangements. But the other bird sneered at him for being a poor simpleton, who did all the hard work, while the other two stayed at home and had a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"good time of it. For, when the mouse had made the fire and fetched in the water, she could retire into her little room and rest until it was time to set the table. The sausage had only to watch the pot to see that the food was properly cooked, and when\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"it was near dinner-time, he just threw himself into the broth, or rolled in and out among the vegetables three or four times, and there they were, buttered, and salted, and ready to be served. Then, when the bird came home and had laid aside his burden,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"they sat down to table, and when they had finished their meal, they could sleep their fill till the following morning: and that was really a very delightful life.

They therefore drew lots, and it fell to the sausage to bring in the wood, to the mouse to cook, and to the bird to fetch the water. And now what happened? The\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"sausage started in search of wood, the bird made the fire, and the mouse put on the pot, and then these two waited till the sausage returned with the fuel for the following day. But the sausage remained so long away, that they became uneasy,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and the bird flew out to meet him. He had not flown far, however, when he came across a dog who, having met the sausage, had regarded him as his legitimate booty, and so seized and swallowed him. The bird complained to the dog of this\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"bare-faced robbery, but nothing he said was of any avail, for the dog answered that he found false credentials on the sausage, and that was the reason his life had been forfeited. He picked up the wood, and flew sadly home, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"told the mouse all he had seen and heard. They were both very unhappy, but agreed to make the best of things and to remain with one another. So now the bird set the table, and the mouse looked after the food and, wishing to prepare it in the same way\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"as the sausage, by rolling in and out among the vegetables to salt and butter them, she jumped into the pot; but she stopped short long before she reached the bottom, having already parted not only with her skin and hair, but also with life.

And one day when the shepherd and his wife were standing together before the house the shepherd said, 'I will shoot old Sultan tomorrow morning, for he is\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"of no use now.' But his wife said, 'Pray let the poor faithful creature live; he has served us well a great many years, and we ought to give him a livelihood for the rest of his days.' 'But what can we do with him?' said the shepherd, 'he has not a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"tooth in his head, and the thieves don't care for him at all; to be sure he has served us, but then he did it to earn his livelihood; tomorrow shall be his last day, depend upon it.' Poor Sultan, who was lying close by them, heard all that the shepherd\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and his wife said to one another, and was very much frightened to think tomorrow would be his last day; so in the evening he went to his good friend the wolf, who lived in the wood, and told him all his sorrows, and how his master meant to kill him in\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the morning. 'Make yourself easy,' said the wolf, 'I will give you some good advice.

The dog liked this plan very well; and accordingly so it was managed. The wolf ran with the child a little way; the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"shepherd and his wife screamed out; but Sultan soon overtook him, and carried the poor little thing back to his master and mistress.

'No,' said the Sultan; 'I will be true to my master.' However, the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"wolf thought he was in joke, and came one night to get a dainty morsel. But Sultan had told his master what the wolf meant to do; so he laid wait for him behind the barn door, and when the wolf was busy looking out for a good fat sheep, he had a stout\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"cudgel laid about his back, that combed his locks for him finely. Then the wolf was very angry, and called Sultan 'an old rogue,' and swore he would have his revenge. So the next morning the wolf sent the boar to challenge Sultan to come into the wood\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"to fight the matter. Now Sultan had nobody he could ask to be his second but the shepherd's old three-legged cat; so he took her with him, and as the poor thing limped along with some trouble, she stuck up her tail straight in the air.

One day the woman was\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"standing by this window and looking down into the garden, when she saw a bed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion (rapunzel), and it looked so fresh and green that she longed for it, she quite pined away, and began to look pale\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and miserable. Then her husband was alarmed, and asked: 'What ails you, dear wife?' 'Ah,' she replied, 'if I can't eat some of the rampion, which is in the garden behind our house, I shall die.' The man, who loved her, thought: 'Sooner than let your\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"wife die, bring her some of the rampion yourself, let it cost what it will.' At twilight, he clambered down over the wall into the garden of the enchantress, hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to his wife. She at once made herself a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"salad of it, and ate it greedily. It tasted so good to her--so very good, that the next day she longed for it three times as much as before. If he was to have any rest, her husband must once more descend into the garden. In the gloom of evening\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"therefore, he let himself down again; but when he had clambered down the wall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the enchantress standing before him. 'How can you dare,' said she with angry look, 'descend into my garden and steal my rampion like a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"thief? You shall suffer for it!' 'Ah,' answered he, 'let mercy take the place of justice, I only made up my mind to do it out of necessity. My wife saw your rampion from the window, and felt such a longing for it that she would have died if she had not\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"got some to eat.' Then the enchantress allowed her anger to be softened, and said to him: 'If the case be as you say, I will allow you to take away with you as much rampion as you will, only I make one condition, you must give me the child which your\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"wife will bring into the world; it shall be well treated, and I will care for it like a mother.' The man in his terror consented to everything, and when the woman was brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at once, gave the child the name of\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Rapunzel, and took it away with her. Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun. When she was twelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a tower, which lay in a forest, and had neither stairs nor door, but quite at the top\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"was a little window. When the enchantress wanted to go in, she placed herself beneath it and cried: 'Rapunzel, Rapunzel, Let down your hair to me.' Rapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when she heard the voice\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"of the enchantress she unfastened her braided tresses, wound them round one of the hooks of the window above, and then the hair fell twenty ells down, and the enchantress climbed up by it. After a year or two, it came to pass that the king's son rode\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"through the forest and passed by the tower. Then he heard a song, which was so charming that he stood still and listened. This was Rapunzel, who in her solitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound. The king's son wanted to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"climb up to her, and looked for the door of the tower, but none was to be found. He rode home, but the singing had so deeply touched his heart, that every day he went out into the forest and listened to it. Once when he was thus standing behind a tree,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"he saw that an enchantress came there, and he heard how she cried: 'Rapunzel, Rapunzel, Let down your hair to me.' Then Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the enchantress climbed up to her. 'If that is the ladder by which one mounts, I too\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"will try my fortune,' said he, and the next day when it began to grow dark, he went to the tower and cried: 'Rapunzel, Rapunzel, Let down your hair to me.' Immediately the hair fell down and the king's son climbed up. At first Rapunzel was terribly\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"frightened when a man, such as her eyes had never yet beheld, came to her; but the king's son began to talk to her quite like a friend, and told her that his heart had been so stirred that it had let him have no rest, and he had been forced to see her.\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Then Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would take him for her husband, and she saw that he was young and handsome, she thought: 'He will love me more than old Dame Gothel does'; and she said yes, and laid her hand in his. She said: 'I\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"will willingly go away with you, but I do not know how to get down. Bring with you a skein of silk every time that you come, and I will weave a ladder with it, and when that is ready I will descend, and you will take me on your horse.' They agreed that\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"until that time he should come to her every evening, for the old woman came by day. The enchantress remarked nothing of this, until once Rapunzel said to her: 'Tell me, Dame Gothel, how it happens that you are so much heavier for me to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"draw up than the young king's son--he is with me in a moment.' 'Ah! you wicked child,' cried the enchantress. 'What do I hear you say! I thought I had separated you from all the world, and yet you have deceived me!' In her anger she clutched\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Rapunzel's beautiful tresses, wrapped them twice round her left hand, seized a pair of scissors with the right, and snip, snap, they were cut off, and the lovely braids lay on the ground. And she was so pitiless that she took poor Rapunzel into a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"desert where she had to live in great grief and misery. On the same day that she cast out Rapunzel, however, the enchantress fastened the braids of hair, which she had cut off, to the hook of the window, and when the king's son came and cried:\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"'Rapunzel, Rapunzel, Let down your hair to me.' she let the hair down. The king's son ascended, but instead of finding his dearest Rapunzel, he found the enchantress, who gazed at him with wicked and venomous looks. 'Aha!' she cried mockingly, 'you\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"would fetch your dearest, but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest; the cat has got it, and will scratch out your eyes as well. Rapunzel is lost to you; you will never see her again.' The king's son was beside himself with pain, and in\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"his despair he leapt down from the tower. He escaped with his life, but the thorns into which he fell pierced his eyes. Then he wandered quite blind about the forest, ate nothing but roots and berries, and did naught but lament and weep over the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"loss of his dearest wife. Thus he roamed about in misery for some years, and at length came to the desert where Rapunzel, with the twins to which she had given birth, a boy and a girl, lived in wretchedness. He heard a voice, and it seemed so familiar\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"to him that he went towards it, and when he approached, Rapunzel knew him and fell on his neck and wept. Two of her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again, and he could see with them as before. He led her to his kingdom where he was joyfully\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"received, and they lived for a long time afterwards, happy and contented.\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

One day the child was very troublesome, and the mother could not quiet it, do what she would. She grew impatient, and seeing the ravens flying round the castle, she opened\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the window, and said: 'I wish you were a raven and would fly away, then I should have a little peace.' Scarcely were the words out of her mouth, when the child in her arms was turned into a raven, and flew away from her through the open window. The bird\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"took its flight to a dark wood and remained there for a long time, and meanwhile the parents could hear nothing of their child. Long after this, a man was making his way through the wood when he heard a raven calling, and he followed the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"sound of the voice. As he drew near, the raven said, 'I am by birth a king's daughter, but am now under the spell of some enchantment; you can, however, set me free.' 'What am I to do?' he asked. She replied, 'Go farther into the wood until you come to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"a house, wherein lives an old woman; she will offer you food and drink, but you must not take of either; if you do, you will fall into a deep sleep, and will not be able to help me. In the garden behind the house is a large tan-heap, and on that you\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"must stand and watch for me. I shall drive there in my carriage at two o'clock in the afternoon for three successive days; the first day it will be drawn by four white, the second by four chestnut, and the last by four black horses; but if you fail to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"keep awake and I find you sleeping, I shall not be set free.' The man promised to do all that she wished, but the raven said, 'Alas! I know even now that you will take something from the woman and be unable to save me.' The man assured her again that he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"would on no account touch a thing to eat or drink. When he came to the house and went inside, the old woman met him, and said, 'Poor man! how tired you are! Come in and rest and let me give you something to eat and drink.' 'No,' answered the man, 'I\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"will neither eat not drink.' But she would not leave him alone, and urged him saying, 'If you will not eat anything, at least you might take a draught of wine; one drink counts for nothing,' and at last he allowed himself to be persuaded, and drank. As\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"it drew towards the appointed hour, he went outside into the garden and mounted the tan-heap to await the raven. Suddenly a feeling of fatigue came over him, and unable to resist it, he lay down for a little while, fully determined, however, to keep\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"awake; but in another minute his eyes closed of their own accord, and he fell into such a deep sleep, that all the noises in the world would not have awakened him. At two o'clock the raven came driving along, drawn by her four white horses; but\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"even before she reached the spot, she said to herself, sighing, 'I know he has fallen asleep.' When she entered the garden, there she found him as she had feared, lying on the tan-heap, fast asleep. She got out of her carriage and went to him; she\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"called him and shook him, but it was all in vain, he still continued sleeping. The next day at noon, the old woman came to him again with food and drink which he at first refused. At last, overcome by her persistent entreaties that he would take\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"something, he lifted the glass and drank again. Towards two o'clock he went into the garden and on to the tan-heap to watch for the raven. He had not been there long before he began to feel so tired that his limbs seemed hardly able to support him, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"he could not stand upright any longer; so again he lay down and fell fast asleep. As the raven drove along her four chestnut horses, she said sorrowfully to herself, 'I know he has fallen asleep.' She went as before to look for him, but he slept, and it\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"was impossible to awaken him. The following day the old woman said to him, 'What is this? You are not eating or drinking anything, do you want to kill yourself?' He answered, 'I may not and will not either eat or drink.' But she put down the dish of\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"food and the glass of wine in front of him, and when he smelt the wine, he was unable to resist the temptation, and took a deep draught. When the hour came round again he went as usual on to the tan-heap in the garden to await the king's daughter,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"but he felt even more overcome with weariness than on the two previous days, and throwing himself down, he slept like a log. At two o'clock the raven could be seen approaching, and this time her coachman and everything about her, as well\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"as her horses, were black. She was sadder than ever as she drove along, and said mournfully, 'I know he has fallen asleep, and will not be able to set me free.' She found him sleeping heavily, and all her efforts to awaken him were of no avail. Then\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"she placed beside him a loaf, and some meat, and a flask of wine, of such a kind, that however much he took of them, they would never grow less. After that she drew a gold ring, on which her name was engraved, off her finger, and put it upon one of his.\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Finally, she laid a letter near him, in which, after giving him particulars of the food and drink she had left for him, she finished with the following words: 'I see that as long as you remain here you will never be able to set me free; if, however, you\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"still wish to do so, come to the golden castle of Stromberg; this is well within your power to accomplish.' She then returned to her carriage and drove to the golden castle of Stromberg. When the man awoke and found that he had been sleeping, he was\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"grieved at heart, and said, 'She has no doubt been here and driven away again, and it is now too late for me to save her.' Then his eyes fell on the things which were lying beside him; he read the letter, and knew from it all that had happened. He rose\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"up without delay, eager to start on his way and to reach the castle of Stromberg, but he had no idea in which direction he ought to go. He travelled about a long time in search of it and came at last to a dark forest, through which he went on walking\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"for fourteen days and still could not find a way out. Once more the night came on, and worn out he lay down under a bush and fell asleep. Again the next day he pursued his way through the forest, and that evening, thinking to rest again, he lay down\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"as before, but he heard such a howling and wailing that he found it impossible to sleep. He waited till it was darker and people had begun to light up their houses, and then seeing a little glimmer ahead of him, he went towards it. He found that the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"light came from a house which looked smaller than it really was, from the contrast of its height with that of an immense giant who stood in front of it. He thought to himself, 'If the giant sees me going in, my life will not be worth much.' However,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"after a while he summoned up courage and went forward. When the giant saw him, he called out, 'It is lucky for that you have come, for I have not had anything to eat for a long time. I can have you now for my supper.' 'I would rather you let\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"that alone,' said the man, 'for I do not willingly give myself up to be eaten; if you are wanting food I have enough to satisfy your hunger.' 'If that is so,' replied the giant, 'I will leave you in peace; I only thought of eating you because I had\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"nothing else.' So they went indoors together and sat down, and the man brought out the bread, meat, and wine, which although he had eaten and drunk of them, were still unconsumed. The giant was pleased with the good cheer, and ate and drank to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"his heart's content. When he had finished his supper the man asked him if he could direct him to the castle of Stromberg. The giant said, 'I will look on my map; on it are marked all the towns, villages, and houses.' So he fetched his map, and looked\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"for the castle, but could not find it. 'Never mind,' he said, 'I have larger maps upstairs in the cupboard, we will look on those,' but they searched in vain, for the castle was not marked even on these. The man now thought he should like to continue\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"his journey, but the giant begged him to remain for a day or two longer until the return of his brother, who was away in search of provisions. When the brother came home, they asked him about the castle of Stromberg, and he told them he would\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"look on his own maps as soon as he had eaten and appeased his hunger. Accordingly, when he had finished his supper, they all went up together to his room and looked through his maps, but the castle was not to be found. Then he fetched other\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"older maps, and they went on looking for the castle until at last they found it, but it was many thousand miles away. 'How shall I be able to get there?' asked the man. 'I have two hours to spare,' said the giant, 'and I will carry you into the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"neighbourhood of the castle; I must then return to look after the child who is in our care.' The giant, thereupon, carried the man to within about a hundred leagues of the castle, where he left him, saying, 'You will be able to walk the remainder of the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"way yourself.' The man journeyed on day and night till he reached the golden castle of Stromberg. He found it situated, however, on a glass mountain, and looking up from the foot he saw the enchanted maiden drive round her castle and then go inside. He\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"was overjoyed to see her, and longed to get to the top of the mountain, but the sides were so slippery that every time he attempted to climb he fell back again. When he saw that it was impossible to reach her, he was greatly grieved, and said to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"himself, 'I will remain here and wait for her,' so he built himself a little hut, and there he sat and watched for a whole year, and every day he saw the king's daughter driving round her castle, but still was unable to get nearer to her. Looking out\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"from his hut one day he saw three robbers fighting and he called out to them, 'God be with you.' They stopped when they heard the call, but looking round and seeing nobody, they went on again with their fighting, which now became more furious. 'God be\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"with you,' he cried again, and again they paused and looked about, but seeing no one went back to their fighting. A third time he called out, 'God be with you,' and then thinking he should like to know the cause of dispute between the three men, he went\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"out and asked them why they were fighting so angrily with one another. One of them said that he had found a stick, and that he had but to strike it against any door through which he wished to pass, and it immediately flew open. Another told him that he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"had found a cloak which rendered its wearer invisible; and the third had caught a horse which would carry its rider over any obstacle, and even up the glass mountain. They had been unable to decide whether they would keep together and have the things in\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"common, or whether they would separate. On hearing this, the man said, 'I will give you something in exchange for those three things; not money, for that I have not got, but something that is of far more value. I must first, however, prove whether all\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"you have told me about your three things is true.' The robbers, therefore, made him get on the horse, and handed him the stick and the cloak, and when he had put this round him he was no longer visible. Then he fell upon them with the stick and beat\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"them one after another, crying, 'There, you idle vagabonds, you have got what you deserve; are you satisfied now!' After this he rode up the glass mountain. When he reached the gate of the castle, he found it closed, but he gave it a blow\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"with his stick, and it flew wide open at once and he passed through. He mounted the steps and entered the room where the maiden was sitting, with a golden goblet full of wine in front of her. She could not see him for he still wore his cloak. He took\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the ring which she had given him off his finger, and threw it into the goblet, so that it rang as it touched the bottom. 'That is my own ring,' she exclaimed, 'and if that is so the man must also be here who is coming to set me free.' She sought for him\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"about the castle, but could find him nowhere. Meanwhile he had gone outside again and mounted his horse and thrown off the cloak. When therefore she came to the castle gate she saw him, and cried aloud for joy. Then he dismounted and took her in his\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"arms; and she kissed him, and said, 'Now you have indeed set me free, and tomorrow we will celebrate our marriage.'\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

He said to himself, 'I will give her to the first suitable man who comes and asks for her hand.' Not long\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"after a suitor appeared, and as he appeared to be very rich and the miller could see nothing in him with which to find fault, he betrothed his daughter to him. But the girl did not care for the man as a girl ought to care for her betrothed husband. She\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"did not feel that she could trust him, and she could not look at him nor think of him without an inward shudder. One day he said to her, 'You have not yet paid me a visit, although we have been betrothed for some time.' 'I do not know where your house\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"is,' she answered. 'My house is out there in the dark forest,' he said. She tried to excuse herself by saying that she would not be able to find the way thither. Her betrothed only replied, 'You must come and see me next Sunday; I have already invited\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"guests for that day, and that you may not mistake the way, I will strew ashes along the path.' When Sunday came, and it was time for the girl to start, a feeling of dread came over her which she could not explain, and that she might be able to find her\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"path again, she filled her pockets with peas and lentils to sprinkle on the ground as she went along. On reaching the entrance to the forest she found the path strewed with ashes, and these she followed, throwing down some peas on either side of her\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"at every step she took. She walked the whole day until she came to the deepest, darkest part of the forest. There she saw a lonely house, looking so grim and mysterious, that it did not please her at all. She stepped inside, but not a soul was to be\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"seen, and a great silence reigned throughout. Suddenly a voice cried: 'Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair, Linger not in this murderers' lair.' The girl looked up and saw that the voice came from a bird hanging in a cage on the wall. Again it\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"cried: 'Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair, Linger not in this murderers' lair.' The girl passed on, going from room to room of the house, but they were all empty, and still she saw no one. At last she came to the cellar, and there sat a very, very\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"old woman, who could not keep her head from shaking. 'Can you tell me,' asked the girl, 'if my betrothed husband lives here?' 'Ah, you poor child,' answered the old woman, 'what a place for you to come to! This is a murderers' den. You think yourself a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"promised bride, and that your marriage will soon take place, but it is with death that you will keep your marriage feast. Look, do you see that large cauldron of water which I am obliged to keep on the fire! As soon as they have you in their power they\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"will kill you without mercy, and cook and eat you, for they are eaters of men. If I did not take pity on you and save you, you would be lost.' Thereupon the old woman led her behind a large cask, which quite hid her from view. 'Keep as still as a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"mouse,' she said; 'do not move or speak, or it will be all over with you. Tonight, when the robbers are all asleep, we will flee together. I have long been waiting for an opportunity to escape.' The words were hardly out of her mouth when the godless\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"crew returned, dragging another young girl along with them. They were all drunk, and paid no heed to her cries and lamentations. They gave her wine to drink, three glasses full, one of white wine, one of red, and one of yellow, and with that her heart\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"gave way and she died. Then they tore of her dainty clothing, laid her on a table, and cut her beautiful body into pieces, and sprinkled salt upon it. The poor betrothed girl crouched trembling and shuddering behind the cask, for she saw what a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"terrible fate had been intended for her by the robbers. One of them now noticed a gold ring still remaining on the little finger of the murdered girl, and as he could not draw it off easily, he took a hatchet and cut off the finger; but the finger\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"sprang into the air, and fell behind the cask into the lap of the girl who was hiding there. The robber took a light and began looking for it, but he could not find it. 'Have you looked behind the large cask?' said one of the others. But the old woman\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"called out, 'Come and eat your suppers, and let the thing be till tomorrow; the finger won't run away.' 'The old woman is right,' said the robbers, and they ceased looking for the finger and sat down. The old woman then mixed a sleeping draught with\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"their wine, and before long they were all lying on the floor of the cellar, fast asleep and snoring. As soon as the girl was assured of this, she came from behind the cask. She was obliged to step over the bodies of the sleepers, who were lying close\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"together, and every moment she was filled with renewed dread lest she should awaken them. But God helped her, so that she passed safely over them, and then she and the old woman went upstairs, opened the door, and hastened as fast as they could from\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the murderers' den. They found the ashes scattered by the wind, but the peas and lentils had sprouted, and grown sufficiently above the ground, to guide them in the moonlight along the path. All night long they walked, and it was morning before\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"they reached the mill. Then the girl told her father all that had happened. The day came that had been fixed for the marriage. The bridegroom arrived and also a large company of guests, for the miller had taken care to invite all his friends and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"relations. As they sat at the feast, each guest in turn was asked to tell a tale; the bride sat still and did not say a word. 'And you, my love,' said the bridegroom, turning to her, 'is there no tale you know? Tell us something.' 'I will tell you a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"dream, then,' said the bride. 'I went alone through a forest and came at last to a house; not a soul could I find within, but a bird that was hanging in a cage on the wall cried: 'Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair, Linger not in this murderers'\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"lair.' and again a second time it said these words.' 'My darling, this is only a dream.' 'I went on through the house from room to room, but they were all empty, and everything was so grim and mysterious. At last I went down to the cellar, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her head still. I asked her if my betrothed lived here, and she answered, \\\\\\\"Ah, you poor child, you are come to a murderers' den; your betrothed does indeed live here, but he will kill you\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"without mercy and afterwards cook and eat you.\\\\\\\"' 'My darling, this is only a dream.' 'The old woman hid me behind a large cask, and scarcely had she done this when the robbers returned home, dragging a young girl along with them. They gave her three\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"kinds of wine to drink, white, red, and yellow, and with that she died.' 'My darling, this is only a dream.' 'Then they tore off her dainty clothing, and cut her beautiful body into pieces and sprinkled salt upon it.' 'My darling, this is only a dream.'\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"'And one of the robbers saw that there was a gold ring still left on her finger, and as it was difficult to draw off, he took a hatchet and cut off her finger; but the finger sprang into the air and fell behind the great cask into my lap.

The bridegroom, who during this recital had grown deadly pale, up and tried to escape, but the guests seized him and held him fast.\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"They delivered him up to justice, and he and all his murderous band were condemned to death for their wicked deeds.\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

The miller's house was close by, and the miller, you must know, had a very beautiful daughter. She was, moreover, very shrewd and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"clever; and the miller was so proud of her, that he one day told the king of the land, who used to come and hunt in the wood, that his daughter could spin gold out of straw. Now this king was very fond of money; and when he heard the miller's boast his\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"greediness was raised, and he sent for the girl to be brought before him. Then he led her to a chamber in his palace where there was a great heap of straw, and gave her a spinning-wheel, and said, 'All this must be spun into gold before morning, as you\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"love your life.' It was in vain that the poor maiden said that it was only a silly boast of her father, for that she could do no such thing as spin straw into gold: the chamber door was locked, and she was left alone. She sat down in one corner of the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"room, and began to bewail her hard fate; when on a sudden the door opened, and a droll-looking little man hobbled in, and said, 'Good morrow to you, my good lass; what are you weeping for?' 'Alas!' said she, 'I must spin this straw into gold, and I know\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"not how.' 'What will you give me,' said the hobgoblin, 'to do it for you?' 'My necklace,' replied the maiden. He took her at her word, and sat himself down to the wheel, and whistled and sang: 'Round about, round about, Lo and behold! Reel away, reel\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"away, Straw into gold!' And round about the wheel went merrily; the work was quickly done, and the straw was all spun into gold. When the king came and saw this, he was greatly astonished and pleased; but his heart grew still more greedy of gain,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and he shut up the poor miller's daughter again with a fresh task. Then she knew not what to do, and sat down once more to weep; but the dwarf soon opened the door, and said, 'What will you give me to do your task?' 'The ring on my finger,' said she.\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"So her little friend took the ring, and began to work at the wheel again, and whistled and sang: 'Round about, round about, Lo and behold! Reel away, reel away, Straw into gold!' till, long before morning, all was done again. The king was greatly\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"delighted to see all this glittering treasure; but still he had not enough: so he took the miller's daughter to a yet larger heap, and said, 'All this must be spun tonight; and if it is, you shall be my queen.' As soon as she was alone that dwarf came\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"in, and said, 'What will you give me to spin gold for you this third time?' 'I have nothing left,' said she. 'Then say you will give me,' said the little man, 'the first little child that you may have when you are queen.' 'That may never be,' thought\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the miller's daughter: and as she knew no other way to get her task done, she said she would do what he asked. Round went the wheel again to the old song, and the manikin once more spun the heap into gold. The king came in the morning, and, finding all\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"he wanted, was forced to keep his word; so he married the miller's daughter, and she really became queen. At the birth of her first little child she was very glad, and forgot the dwarf, and what she had said. But one day he came into her room, where she\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"was sitting playing with her baby, and put her in mind of it. Then she grieved sorely at her misfortune, and said she would give him all the wealth of the kingdom if he would let her off, but in vain; till at last her tears softened him, and he said, 'I\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"will give you three days' grace, and if during that time you tell me my name, you shall keep your child.' Now the queen lay awake all night, thinking of all the odd names that she had ever heard; and she sent messengers all over the land to find out new\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"ones. The next day the little man came, and she began with TIMOTHY, ICHABOD, BENJAMIN, JEREMIAH, and all the names she could remember; but to all and each of them he said, 'Madam, that is not my name.' The second day she began with all the comical names\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"she could hear of, BANDY-LEGS, HUNCHBACK, CROOK-SHANKS, and so on; but the little gentleman still said to every one of them, 'Madam, that is not my name.' The third day one of the messengers came back, and said, 'I have travelled two\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"days without hearing of any other names; but yesterday, as I was climbing a high hill, among the trees of the forest where the fox and the hare bid each other good night, I saw a little hut; and before the hut burnt a fire; and round about the fire a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"funny little dwarf was dancing upon one leg, and singing: '\\\\\\\"Merrily the feast I'll make.

Then the old woman said, 'Now is the time for getting the bird's\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"heart.' So the lady stole it away, and he never found any more gold under his pillow, for it lay now under the young lady's, and the old woman took it away every morning; but he was so much in love that he never missed his prize. 'Well,' said the old\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"witch, 'we have got the bird's heart, but not the wishing-cloak yet, and that we must also get.' 'Let us leave him that,' said the young lady; 'he has already lost his wealth.' Then the witch was very angry, and said, 'Such a cloak is a very rare and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"wonderful thing, and I must and will have it.' So she did as the old woman told her, and set herself at the window, and looked about the country and seemed very sorrowful; then the huntsman said, 'What makes you so sad?' 'Alas! dear sir,' said she,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"'yonder lies the granite rock where all the costly diamonds grow, and I want so much to go there, that whenever I think of it I cannot help being sorrowful, for who can reach it? only the birds and the flies--man cannot.' 'If that's all your\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"grief,' said the huntsman, 'I'll take there with all my heart'; so he drew her under his cloak, and the moment he wished to be on the granite mountain they were both there. The diamonds glittered so on all sides that they were delighted with the sight\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and picked up the finest. But the old witch made a deep sleep come upon him, and he said to the young lady, 'Let us sit down and rest ourselves a little, I am so tired that I cannot stand any longer.' So they sat down, and he laid his head in her lap\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and fell asleep; and whilst he was sleeping on she took the cloak from his shoulders, hung it on her own, picked up the diamonds, and wished herself home again. When he awoke and found that his lady had tricked him, and left him alone on the wild rock,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"he said, 'Alas! what roguery there is in the world!' and there he sat in great grief and fear, not knowing what to do. Now this rock belonged to fierce giants who lived upon it; and as he saw three of them striding about, he thought to himself, 'I can\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"only save myself by feigning to be asleep'; so he laid himself down as if he were in a sound sleep. When the giants came up to him, the first pushed him with his foot, and said, 'What worm is this that lies here curled up?' 'Tread upon him and kill\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"him,' said the second. 'It's not worth the trouble,' said the third; 'let him live, he'll go climbing higher up the mountain, and some cloud will come rolling and carry him away.' And they passed on. But the huntsman had heard all they said; and as soon\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"as they were gone, he climbed to the top of the mountain, and when he had sat there a short time a cloud came rolling around him, and caught him in a whirlwind and bore him along for some time, till it settled in a garden, and he fell quite gently to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the ground amongst the greens and cabbages. Then he looked around him, and said, 'I wish I had something to eat, if not I shall be worse off than before; for here I see neither apples nor pears, nor any kind of fruits, nothing but vegetables.' At\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"last he thought to himself, 'I can eat salad, it will refresh and strengthen me.' So he picked out a fine head and ate of it; but scarcely had he swallowed two bites when he felt himself quite changed, and saw with horror that he was turned into an\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"ass. However, he still felt very hungry, and the salad tasted very nice; so he ate on till he came to another kind of salad, and scarcely had he tasted it when he felt another change come over him, and soon saw that he was lucky enough to have found his\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"old shape again. Then he laid himself down and slept off a little of his weariness; and when he awoke the next morning he broke off a head both of the good and the bad salad, and thought to himself, 'This will help me to my fortune again, and enable me\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"to pay off some folks for their treachery.' So he went away to try and find the castle of his friends; and after wandering about a few days he luckily found it. Then he stained his face all over brown, so that even his mother would not have known him,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and went into the castle and asked for a lodging; 'I am so tired,' said he, 'that I can go no farther.' 'Countryman,' said the witch, 'who are you? and what is your business?' 'I am,' said he, 'a messenger sent by the king to find the finest salad that\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"grows under the sun. I have been lucky enough to find it, and have brought it with me; but the heat of the sun scorches so that it begins to wither, and I don't know that I can carry it farther.' When the witch and the young lady heard of his beautiful\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"salad, they longed to taste it, and said, 'Dear countryman, let us just taste it.' 'To be sure,' answered he; 'I have two heads of it with me, and will give you one'; so he opened his bag and gave them the bad. Then the witch herself took it into the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"kitchen to be dressed; and when it was ready she could not wait till it was carried up, but took a few leaves immediately and put them in her mouth, and scarcely were they swallowed when she lost her own form and ran braying down into the court in the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"form of an ass. Now the servant-maid came into the kitchen, and seeing the salad ready, was going to carry it up; but on the way she too felt a wish to taste it as the old woman had done, and ate some leaves; so she also was turned into an ass and ran\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"after the other, letting the dish with the salad fall on the ground. The messenger sat all this time with the beautiful young lady, and as nobody came with the salad and she longed to taste it, she said, 'I don't know where the salad can be.' Then he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"thought something must have happened, and said, 'I will go into the kitchen and see.' And as he went he saw two asses in the court running about, and the salad lying on the ground. 'All right!' said he; 'those two have had their share.' Then he took up\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the rest of the leaves, laid them on the dish and brought them to the young lady, saying, 'I bring you the dish myself that you may not wait any longer.' So she ate of it, and like the others ran off into the court braying away. Then the huntsman washed\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"his face and went into the court that they might know him. 'Now you shall be paid for your roguery,' said he; and tied them all three to a rope and took them along with him till he came to a mill and knocked at the window. 'What's the matter?' said the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"miller. 'I have three tiresome beasts here,' said the other; 'if you will take them, give them food and room, and treat them as I tell you, I will pay you whatever you ask.' 'With all my heart,' said the miller; 'but how shall I treat them?' Then the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"huntsman said, 'Give the old one stripes three times a day and hay once; give the next (who was the servant-maid) stripes once a day and hay three times; and give the youngest (who was the beautiful lady) hay three times a day and no stripes':\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"for he could not find it in his heart to have her beaten. After this he went back to the castle, where he found everything he wanted. Some days after, the miller came to him and told him that the old ass was dead; 'The other two,' said he, 'are alive\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and eat, but are so sorrowful that they cannot last long.' Then the huntsman pitied them, and told the miller to drive them back to him, and when they came, he gave them some of the good salad to eat. And the beautiful young lady fell upon her knees\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"before him, and said, 'O dearest huntsman! forgive me all the ill I have done you; my mother forced me to it, it was against my will, for I always loved you very much. Your wishing-cloak hangs up in the closet, and as for the bird's heart, I will give\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"it you too.' But he said, 'Keep it, it will be just the same thing, for I mean to make you my wife.' So they were married, and lived together very happily till they died.\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

And the glass answered: 'Thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land: But over the hills, in the greenwood shade, Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"There Snowdrop is hiding her head; and she Is lovelier far, O queen! than thee.' Then the queen was very much frightened; for she knew that the glass always spoke the truth, and was sure that the servant had betrayed her. And she could not\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"bear to think that anyone lived who was more beautiful than she was; so she dressed herself up as an old pedlar, and went her way over the hills, to the place where the dwarfs dwelt. Then she knocked at the door, and cried, 'Fine wares to sell!'\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Snowdrop looked out at the window, and said, 'Good day, good woman! what have you to sell?' 'Good wares, fine wares,' said she; 'laces and bobbins of all colours.' 'I will let the old lady in; she seems to be a very good sort of body,' thought Snowdrop,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"as she ran down and unbolted the door. 'Bless me!' said the old woman, 'how badly your stays are laced! Let me lace them up with one of my nice new laces.' Snowdrop did not dream of any mischief; so she stood before the old woman; but she\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"set to work so nimbly, and pulled the lace so tight, that Snowdrop's breath was stopped, and she fell down as if she were dead. 'There's an end to all thy beauty,' said the spiteful queen, and went away home. In the evening the seven dwarfs came home;\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and I need not say how grieved they were to see their faithful Snowdrop stretched out upon the ground, as if she was quite dead. However, they lifted her up, and when they found what ailed her, they cut the lace; and in a little time she began to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"breathe, and very soon came to life again. Then they said, 'The old woman was the queen herself; take care another time, and let no one in when we are away.' When the queen got home, she went straight to her glass, and spoke to it as before; but to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"her great grief it still said: 'Thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land: But over the hills, in the greenwood shade, Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made, There Snowdrop is hiding her head; and she Is lovelier far, O\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"queen! than thee.' Then the blood ran cold in her heart with spite and malice, to see that Snowdrop still lived; and she dressed herself up again, but in quite another dress from the one she wore before, and took with her a poisoned comb. When she\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"reached the dwarfs' cottage, she knocked at the door, and cried, 'Fine wares to sell!' But Snowdrop said, 'I dare not let anyone in.' Then the queen said, 'Only look at my beautiful combs!' and gave her the poisoned one. And it looked so pretty, that\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"she took it up and put it into her hair to try it; but the moment it touched her head, the poison was so powerful that she fell down senseless. 'There you may lie,' said the queen, and went her way. But by good luck the dwarfs came in very early that\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"evening; and when they saw Snowdrop lying on the ground, they thought what had happened, and soon found the poisoned comb. And when they took it away she got well, and told them all that had passed; and they warned her once more not to open\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the door to anyone. Meantime the queen went home to her glass, and shook with rage when she read the very same answer as before; and she said, 'Snowdrop shall die, if it cost me my life.' So she went by herself into her chamber, and got ready a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"poisoned apple: the outside looked very rosy and tempting, but whoever tasted it was sure to die. Then she dressed herself up as a peasant's wife, and travelled over the hills to the dwarfs' cottage, and knocked at the door; but Snowdrop put her head\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"out of the window and said, 'I dare not let anyone in, for the dwarfs have told me not.' 'Do as you please,' said the old woman, 'but at any rate take this pretty apple; I will give it you.' 'No,' said Snowdrop, 'I dare not take it.' 'You silly girl!'\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"answered the other, 'what are you afraid of? Do you think it is poisoned? Come! do you eat one part, and I will eat the other.' Now the apple was so made up that one side was good, though the other side was poisoned. Then Snowdrop was much tempted to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"taste, for the apple looked so very nice; and when she saw the old woman eat, she could wait no longer. But she had scarcely put the piece into her mouth, when she fell down dead upon the ground. 'This time nothing will save thee,' said the queen; and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"she went home to her glass, and at last it said: 'Thou, queen, art the fairest of all the fair.' And then her wicked heart was glad, and as happy as such a heart could be. When evening came, and the dwarfs had gone home, they found Snowdrop lying on the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"ground: no breath came from her lips, and they were afraid that she was quite dead. They lifted her up, and combed her hair, and washed her face with wine and water; but all was in vain, for the little girl seemed quite dead. So they laid her down upon\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"a bier, and all seven watched and bewailed her three whole days; and then they thought they would bury her: but her cheeks were still rosy; and her face looked just as it did while she was alive; so they said, 'We will never bury her in the cold\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"ground.' And they made a coffin of glass, so that they might still look at her, and wrote upon it in golden letters what her name was, and that she was a king's daughter. And the coffin was set among the hills, and one of the dwarfs always sat by it and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"watched. And the birds of the air came too, and bemoaned Snowdrop; and first of all came an owl, and then a raven, and at last a dove, and sat by her side. And thus Snowdrop lay for a long, long time, and still only looked as though she was asleep; for\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"she was even now as white as snow, and as red as blood, and as black as ebony. At last a prince came and called at the dwarfs' house; and he saw Snowdrop, and read what was written in golden letters. Then he offered the dwarfs money, and prayed and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"besought them to let him take her away; but they said, 'We will not part with her for all the gold in the world.' At last, however, they had pity on him, and gave him the coffin; but the moment he lifted it up to carry it home with him, the piece of\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"apple fell from between her lips, and Snowdrop awoke, and said, 'Where am I?' And the prince said, 'Thou art quite safe with me.' Then he told her all that had happened, and said, 'I love you far better than all the world; so come with me to my father's\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"palace, and you shall be my wife.' And Snowdrop consented, and went home with the prince; and everything was got ready with great pomp and splendour for their wedding. To the feast was asked, among the rest, Snowdrop's old enemy the queen; and as\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"she was dressing herself in fine rich clothes, she looked in the glass and said: 'Tell me, glass, tell me true! Of all the ladies in the land, Who is fairest, tell me, who?' And the glass answered: 'Thou, lady, art loveliest here, I ween; But lovelier\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"far is the new-made queen.' When she heard this she started with rage; but her envy and curiosity were so great, that she could not help setting out to see the bride. And when she got there, and saw that it was no other than Snowdrop, who, as\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"she thought, had been dead a long while, she choked with rage, and fell down and died: but Snowdrop and the prince lived and reigned happily over that land many, many years; and sometimes they went up into the mountains, and paid a visit to the little\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"dwarfs, who had been so kind to Snowdrop in her time of need.\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

In front of the cottage was a garden wherein stood two rose-trees, one of which bore white and the other red roses. She had two children who were like the two rose-trees, and one was called\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Snow-white, and the other Rose-red. They were as good and happy, as busy and cheerful as ever two children in the world were, only Snow-white was more quiet and gentle than Rose-red. Rose-red liked better to run about in the meadows and fields seeking\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"flowers and catching butterflies; but Snow-white sat at home with her mother, and helped her with her housework, or read to her when there was nothing to do. The two children were so fond of one another that they always held each other by the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"hand when they went out together, and when Snow-white said: 'We will not leave each other,' Rose-red answered: 'Never so long as we live,' and their mother would add: 'What one has she must share with the other.' They often ran about the forest alone\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and gathered red berries, and no beasts did them any harm, but came close to them trustfully. The little hare would eat a cabbage-leaf out of their hands, the roe grazed by their side, the stag leapt merrily by them, and the birds sat still upon the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"boughs, and sang whatever they knew. Once when they had spent the night in the wood and the dawn had roused them, they saw a beautiful child in a shining white dress sitting near their bed. He got up and looked quite kindly at them, but said nothing and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"went into the forest. And when they looked round they found that they had been sleeping quite close to a precipice, and would certainly have fallen into it in the darkness if they had gone only a few paces further. And their mother told them that it\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"must have been the angel who watches over good children. Snow-white and Rose-red kept their mother's little cottage so neat that it was a pleasure to look inside it. In the summer Rose-red took care of the house, and every morning laid a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"wreath of flowers by her mother's bed before she awoke, in which was a rose from each tree. In the winter Snow-white lit the fire and hung the kettle on the hob. In the evening, when the snowflakes fell, the mother said: 'Go, Snow-white, and bolt the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"door,' and then they sat round the hearth, and the mother took her spectacles and read aloud out of a large book, and the two girls listened as they sat and spun. And close by them lay a lamb upon the floor, and behind them upon a perch sat a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"white dove with its head hidden beneath its wings. One evening, as they were thus sitting comfortably together, someone knocked at the door as if he wished to be let in. The mother said: 'Quick, Rose-red, open the door, it must be a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"traveller who is seeking shelter.' Rose-red went and pushed back the bolt, thinking that it was a poor man, but it was not; it was a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door. Rose-red screamed and sprang back, the lamb bleated, the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"dove fluttered, and Snow-white hid herself behind her mother's bed. But the bear began to speak and said: 'Do not be afraid, I will do you no harm! I am half-frozen, and only want to warm myself a little beside you.' 'Poor bear,' said the mother, 'lie\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"down by the fire, only take care that you do not burn your coat.' Then she cried: 'Snow-white, Rose-red, come out, the bear will do you no harm, he means well.' So they both came out, and by-and-by the lamb and dove came nearer, and were\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"not afraid of him. The bear said: 'Here, children, knock the snow out of my coat a little'; so they brought the broom and swept the bear's hide clean; and he stretched himself by the fire and growled contentedly and comfortably. It was not long before\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"they grew quite at home, and played tricks with their clumsy guest. They tugged his hair with their hands, put their feet upon his back and rolled him about, or they took a hazel-switch and beat him, and when he growled they laughed. But the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"bear took it all in good part, only when they were too rough he called out: 'Leave me alive, children, 'Snow-white, Rose-red, Will you beat your wooer dead?' When it was bed-time, and the others went to bed, the mother said to the bear: 'You can lie\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"there by the hearth, and then you will be safe from the cold and the bad weather.' As soon as day dawned the two children let him out, and he trotted across the snow into the forest. Henceforth the bear came every evening at the same time,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"laid himself down by the hearth, and let the children amuse themselves with him as much as they liked; and they got so used to him that the doors were never fastened until their black friend had arrived. When spring had come and all outside was green,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the bear said one morning to Snow-white: 'Now I must go away, and cannot come back for the whole summer.' 'Where are you going, then, dear bear?' asked Snow-white. 'I must go into the forest and guard my treasures from the wicked\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"dwarfs. In the winter, when the earth is frozen hard, they are obliged to stay below and cannot work their way through; but now, when the sun has thawed and warmed the earth, they break through it, and come out to pry and steal; and what once\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"gets into their hands, and in their caves, does not easily see daylight again.' Snow-white was quite sorry at his departure, and as she unbolted the door for him, and the bear was hurrying out, he caught against the bolt and a piece of his hairy\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"coat was torn off, and it seemed to Snow-white as if she had seen gold shining through it, but she was not sure about it. The bear ran away quickly, and was soon out of sight behind the trees. A short time afterwards the mother sent her children into\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the forest to get firewood. There they found a big tree which lay felled on the ground, and close by the trunk something was jumping backwards and forwards in the grass, but they could not make out what it was. When they came nearer they saw a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long. The end of the beard was caught in a crevice of the tree, and the little fellow was jumping about like a dog tied to a rope, and did not know what to do. He glared at the girls with\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"his fiery red eyes and cried: 'Why do you stand there? Can you not come here and help me?' 'What are you up to, little man?' asked Rose-red. 'You stupid, prying goose!' answered the dwarf: 'I was going to split the tree to get a little wood for cooking.\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"The little bit of food that we people get is immediately burnt up with heavy logs; we do not swallow so much as you coarse, greedy folk. I had just driven the wedge safely in, and everything was going as I wished; but the cursed wedge was too smooth and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"suddenly sprang out, and the tree closed so quickly that I could not pull out my beautiful white beard; so now it is tight and I cannot get away, and the silly, sleek, milk-faced things laugh! Ugh! how odious you are!' The children tried very hard, but\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"they could not pull the beard out, it was caught too fast. 'I will run and fetch someone,' said Rose-red. 'You senseless goose!' snarled the dwarf; 'why should you fetch someone? You are already two too many for me; can you not think of something\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"better?' 'Don't be impatient,' said Snow-white, 'I will help you,' and she pulled her scissors out of her pocket, and cut off the end of the beard. As soon as the dwarf felt himself free he laid hold of a bag which lay amongst the roots of the tree, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"which was full of gold, and lifted it up, grumbling to himself: 'Uncouth people, to cut off a piece of my fine beard. Bad luck to you!' and then he swung the bag upon his back, and went off without even once looking at the children. Some time afterwards\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Snow-white and Rose-red went to catch a dish of fish. As they came near the brook they saw something like a large grasshopper jumping towards the water, as if it were going to leap in. They ran to it and found it was the dwarf. 'Where are you going?'\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"said Rose-red; 'you surely don't want to go into the water?' 'I am not such a fool!' cried the dwarf; 'don't you see that the accursed fish wants to pull me in?' The little man had been sitting there fishing, and unluckily the wind had tangled up his\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"beard with the fishing-line; a moment later a big fish made a bite and the feeble creature had not strength to pull it out; the fish kept the upper hand and pulled the dwarf towards him. He held on to all the reeds and rushes, but it was of little good,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"for he was forced to follow the movements of the fish, and was in urgent danger of being dragged into the water. The girls came just in time; they held him fast and tried to free his beard from the line, but all in vain, beard and line were entangled\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"fast together. There was nothing to do but to bring out the scissors and cut the beard, whereby a small part of it was lost. When the dwarf saw that he screamed out: 'Is that civil, you toadstool, to disfigure a man's face? Was it not enough to clip off\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the end of my beard? Now you have cut off the best part of it. I cannot let myself be seen by my people. I wish you had been made to run the soles off your shoes!' Then he took out a sack of pearls which lay in the rushes, and without another word he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"dragged it away and disappeared behind a stone. It happened that soon afterwards the mother sent the two children to the town to buy needles and thread, and laces and ribbons. The road led them across a heath upon which huge pieces of rock lay strewn\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"about. There they noticed a large bird hovering in the air, flying slowly round and round above them; it sank lower and lower, and at last settled near a rock not far away. Immediately they heard a loud, piteous cry. They ran up and saw with horror\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"that the eagle had seized their old acquaintance the dwarf, and was going to carry him off. The children, full of pity, at once took tight hold of the little man, and pulled against the eagle so long that at last he let his booty go. As soon as the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"dwarf had recovered from his first fright he cried with his shrill voice: 'Could you not have done it more carefully! You dragged at my brown coat so that it is all torn and full of holes, you clumsy creatures!' Then he took up a sack full of precious\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"stones, and slipped away again under the rock into his hole. The girls, who by this time were used to his ingratitude, went on their way and did their business in town. As they crossed the heath again on their way home they surprised the dwarf, who had\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"emptied out his bag of precious stones in a clean spot, and had not thought that anyone would come there so late. The evening sun shone upon the brilliant stones; they glittered and sparkled with all colours so beautifully that the children stood\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"still and stared at them. 'Why do you stand gaping there?' cried the dwarf, and his ashen-grey face became copper-red with rage. He was still cursing when a loud growling was heard, and a black bear came trotting towards them out of the forest. The\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"dwarf sprang up in a fright, but he could not reach his cave, for the bear was already close. Then in the dread of his heart he cried: 'Dear Mr Bear, spare me, I will give you all my treasures; look, the beautiful jewels lying there! Grant me my life;\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"what do you want with such a slender little fellow as I? you would not feel me between your teeth. Come, take these two wicked girls, they are tender morsels for you, fat as young quails; for mercy's sake eat them!' The bear took no heed of his words,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"but gave the wicked creature a single blow with his paw, and he did not move again. The girls had run away, but the bear called to them: 'Snow-white and Rose-red, do not be afraid; wait, I will come with you.' Then they recognized his voice and waited,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and when he came up to them suddenly his bearskin fell off, and he stood there a handsome man, clothed all in gold. 'I am a king's son,' he said, 'and I was bewitched by that wicked dwarf, who had stolen my treasures; I have had to run about the forest\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"as a savage bear until I was freed by his death. Now he has got his well-deserved punishment. Snow-white was married to him, and Rose-red to his brother, and they divided between them the great treasure which the dwarf\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"had gathered together in his cave. The old mother lived happily with her children for many years. She took the two rose-trees with her, and they stood before her window, and yearly bore the most beautiful roses, white and red.\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: 'Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"coal replied: 'I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain,--I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: 'I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' 'And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw. 'The old woman has destroyed all my brethren in fire and smoke; she seized sixty of them at once, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"took their lives. I luckily slipped through her fingers.' 'But what are we to do now?' said the coal. 'I think,' answered the bean, 'that as we have so fortunately escaped death, we should keep together like good companions, and lest a new mischance\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"should overtake us here, we should go away together, and repair to a foreign country.' The proposition pleased the two others, and they set out on their way together. Soon, however, they came to a little brook, and as there was no bridge or\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"foot-plank, they did not know how they were to get over it. The straw hit on a good idea, and said: 'I will lay myself straight across, and then you can walk over on me as on a bridge.' The straw therefore stretched itself from one bank to the other,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and the coal, who was of an impetuous disposition, tripped quite boldly on to the newly-built bridge.

The\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"straw, however, began to burn, broke in two pieces, and fell into the stream. The coal slipped after her, hissed when she got into the water, and breathed her last.

It would have been all over with her, likewise, if, by good fortune, a tailor who was travelling in search of work, had not sat down to rest by the brook.

The stepdaughter once had a pretty apron, which the other fancied so much that she became envious, and told her mother that she must and would have that apron. 'Be quiet, my child,' said the old woman, 'and you shall have it. Your\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"stepsister has long deserved death; tonight when she is asleep I will come and cut her head off. Only be careful that you are at the far side of the bed, and push her well to the front.' It would have been all over with the poor girl if she had not just\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"then been standing in a corner, and heard everything. All day long she dared not go out of doors, and when bedtime had come, the witch's daughter got into bed first, so as to lie at the far side, but when she was asleep, the other pushed her gently to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the front, and took for herself the place at the back, close by the wall. In the night, the old woman came creeping in, she held an axe in her right hand, and felt with her left to see if anyone were lying at the outside, and then she grasped the axe\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"with both hands, and cut her own child's head off. When she had gone away, the girl got up and went to her sweetheart, who was called Roland, and knocked at his door. When he came out, she said to him: 'Listen, dearest Roland, we must fly in all haste;\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"my stepmother wanted to kill me, but has struck her own child. When daylight comes, and she sees what she has done, we shall be lost.' 'But,' said Roland, 'I counsel you first to take away her magic wand, or we cannot escape if she pursues us.' The\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"maiden fetched the magic wand, and she took the dead girl's head and dropped three drops of blood on the ground, one in front of the bed, one in the kitchen, and one on the stairs. Then she hurried away with her lover. When the old witch got up next\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"morning, she called her daughter, and wanted to give her the apron, but she did not come. Then the witch cried: 'Where are you?' 'Here, on the stairs, I am sweeping,' answered the first drop of blood. The old woman went out, but saw no one on the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"stairs, and cried again: 'Where are you?' 'Here in the kitchen, I am warming myself,' cried the second drop of blood. She went into the kitchen, but found no one. Then she cried again: 'Where are you?' 'Ah, here in the bed, I am sleeping,' cried\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the third drop of blood. She went into the room to the bed. What did she see there? Her own child, whose head she had cut off, bathed in her blood. The witch fell into a passion, sprang to the window, and as she could look forth quite far into the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"world, she perceived her stepdaughter hurrying away with her sweetheart Roland. 'That shall not help you,' cried she, 'even if you have got a long way off, you shall still not escape me.' She put on her many-league boots, in which she covered an\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"hour's walk at every step, and it was not long before she overtook them. The girl, however, when she saw the old woman striding towards her, changed, with her magic wand, her sweetheart Roland into a lake, and herself into a duck swimming in the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"middle of it. The witch placed herself on the shore, threw breadcrumbs in, and went to endless trouble to entice the duck; but the duck did not let herself be enticed, and the old woman had to go home at night as she had come. At this the girl and her\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"sweetheart Roland resumed their natural shapes again, and they walked on the whole night until daybreak. Then the maiden changed herself into a beautiful flower which stood in the midst of a briar hedge, and her sweetheart\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Roland into a fiddler. It was not long before the witch came striding up towards them, and said to the musician: 'Dear musician, may I pluck that beautiful flower for myself?' 'Oh, yes,' he replied, 'I will play to you while you do it.' As she was\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"hastily creeping into the hedge and was just going to pluck the flower, knowing perfectly well who the flower was, he began to play, and whether she would or not, she was forced to dance, for it was a magical dance. The faster he played, the more\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"violent springs was she forced to make, and the thorns tore her clothes from her body, and pricked her and wounded her till she bled, and as he did not stop, she had to dance till she lay dead on the ground. As they were now set free, Roland said: 'Now\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"I will go to my father and arrange for the wedding.' 'Then in the meantime I will stay here and wait for you,' said the girl, 'and that no one may recognize me, I will change myself into a red stone landmark.' Then Roland went away, and the girl stood\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"like a red landmark in the field and waited for her beloved. But when Roland got home, he fell into the snares of another, who so fascinated him that he forgot the maiden. The poor girl remained there a long time, but at length, as he did not return at\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"all, she was sad, and changed herself into a flower, and thought: 'Someone will surely come this way, and trample me down.' It befell, however, that a shepherd kept his sheep in the field and saw the flower, and as it was so pretty, plucked it, took it\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"with him, and laid it away in his chest. From that time forth, strange things happened in the shepherd's house. When he arose in the morning, all the work was already done, the room was swept, the table and benches cleaned, the fire in the hearth was\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"lighted, and the water was fetched, and at noon, when he came home, the table was laid, and a good dinner served. He could not conceive how this came to pass, for he never saw a human being in his house, and no one could have concealed himself\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"in it. He was certainly pleased with this good attendance, but still at last he was so afraid that he went to a wise woman and asked for her advice. The wise woman said: 'There is some enchantment behind it, listen very early some morning if anything\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"is moving in the room, and if you see anything, no matter what it is, throw a white cloth over it, and then the magic will be stopped.' The shepherd did as she bade him, and next morning just as day dawned, he saw the chest open, and the flower come\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"out. Swiftly he sprang towards it, and threw a white cloth over it. Instantly the transformation came to an end, and a beautiful girl stood before him, who admitted to him that she had been the flower, and that up to this time she had attended to his\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"house-keeping. She told him her story, and as she pleased him he asked her if she would marry him, but she answered: 'No,' for she wanted to remain faithful to her sweetheart Roland, although he had deserted her. Nevertheless, she promised not to go\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"away, but to continue keeping house for the shepherd. And now the time drew near when Roland's wedding was to be celebrated, and then, according to an old custom in the country, it was announced that all the girls were to be present at it, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"sing in honour of the bridal pair. When the faithful maiden heard of this, she grew so sad that she thought her heart would break, and she would not go thither, but the other girls came and took her. When it came to her turn to sing, she stepped back,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"until at last she was the only one left, and then she could not refuse. But when she began her song, and it reached Roland's ears, he sprang up and cried: 'I know the voice, that is the true bride, I will have no other!' Everything he had forgotten, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"which had vanished from his mind, had suddenly come home again to his heart. Then the faithful maiden held her wedding with her sweetheart Roland, and grief came to an end and joy began.\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

Then she went to the king, and told him the joyful tidings, and when the time was come she gave birth to a son, and the king was filled with\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"gladness. Every morning she went with the child to the garden where the wild beasts were kept, and washed herself there in a clear stream. It happened once when the child was a little older, that it was lying in her arms and she fell asleep. Then came\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the old cook, who knew that the child had the power of wishing, and stole it away, and he took a hen, and cut it in pieces, and dropped some of its blood on the queen's apron and on her dress. Then he carried the child away to a secret place, where a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"nurse was obliged to suckle it, and he ran to the king and accused the queen of having allowed her child to be taken from her by the wild beasts. When the king saw the blood on her apron, he believed this, fell into such a passion that he ordered a high\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"tower to be built, in which neither sun nor moon could be seen and had his wife put into it, and walled up.

But God sent two angels from heaven in the shape of white doves,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"which flew to her twice a day, and carried her food until the seven years were over. The cook, however, thought to himself: 'If the child has the power of wishing, and I am here, he might very easily get me into trouble.' So he left the palace and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"went to the boy, who was already big enough to speak, and said to him: 'Wish for a beautiful palace for yourself with a garden, and all else that pertains to it.'

So he went out and took the maiden aside, and said: 'Tonight when the boy is asleep, go to his bed and plunge this knife into his heart, and bring me his heart and tongue, and if you do not do it, you shall lose your life.' Thereupon\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"he went away, and when he returned next day she had not done it, and said: 'Why should I shed the blood of an innocent boy who has never harmed anyone?'

When he had gone\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"away, she had a little hind brought to her, and ordered her to be killed, and took her heart and tongue, and laid them on a plate, and when she saw the old man coming, she said to the boy: 'Lie down in your bed, and draw the clothes over you.' Then the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"wicked wretch came in and said: 'Where are the boy's heart and tongue?'

You shall\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"become a black poodle and have a gold collar round your neck, and shall eat burning coals, till the flames burst forth from your throat.' And when he had spoken these words, the old man was changed into a poodle dog, and had a gold collar round his\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"neck, and the cooks were ordered to bring up some live coals, and these he ate, until the flames broke forth from his throat. The king's son remained there a short while longer, and he thought of his mother, and wondered if she were still alive. At\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"length he said to the maiden: 'I will go home to my own country; if you will go with me, I will provide for you.' 'Ah,' she replied, 'the way is so long, and what shall I do in a strange land where I am unknown?' As she did not seem quite willing, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"as they could not be parted from each other, he wished that she might be changed into a beautiful pink, and took her with him. Then he went away to his own country, and the poodle had to run after him. He went to the tower in which his mother was\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"confined, and as it was so high, he wished for a ladder which would reach up to the very top. Then he mounted up and looked inside, and cried: 'Beloved mother, Lady Queen, are you still alive, or are you dead?' She answered: 'I have just eaten, and am\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"still satisfied,' for she thought the angels were there. Said he: 'I am your dear son, whom the wild beasts were said to have torn from your arms; but I am alive still, and will soon set you free.' Then he descended again, and went to his father, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"caused himself to be announced as a strange huntsman, and asked if he could offer him service. The king said yes, if he was skilful and could get game for him, he should come to him, but that deer had never taken up their quarters in any part of the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"district or country. Then the huntsman promised to procure as much game for him as he could possibly use at the royal table. So he summoned all the huntsmen together, and bade them go out into the forest with him. And he went with them and made them\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"form a great circle, open at one end where he stationed himself, and began to wish. Two hundred deer and more came running inside the circle at once, and the huntsmen shot them. Then they were all placed on sixty country carts, and driven home to the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"king, and for once he was able to deck his table with game, after having had none at all for years. Now the king felt great joy at this, and commanded that his entire household should eat with him next day, and made a great feast. When they were all\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"assembled together, he said to the huntsman: 'As you are so clever, you shall sit by me.' He replied: 'Lord King, your majesty must excuse me, I am a poor huntsman.' But the king insisted on it, and said: 'You shall sit by me,' until he did it. Whilst\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"he was sitting there, he thought of his dearest mother, and wished that one of the king's principal servants would begin to speak of her, and would ask how it was faring with the queen in the tower, and if she were alive still, or had perished. Hardly\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"had he formed the wish than the marshal began, and said: 'Your majesty, we live joyously here, but how is the queen living in the tower? Is she still alive, or has she died?' But the king replied: 'She let my dear son be torn to pieces by wild\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"beasts; I will not have her named.' Then the huntsman arose and said: 'Gracious lord father she is alive still, and I am her son, and I was not carried away by wild beasts, but by that wretch the old cook, who tore me from her arms when she was asleep,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and sprinkled her apron with the blood of a chicken.' Thereupon he took the dog with the golden collar, and said: 'That is the wretch!' and caused live coals to be brought, and these the dog was compelled to devour before the sight\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"of all, until flames burst forth from its throat. On this the huntsman asked the king if he would like to see the dog in his true shape, and wished him back into the form of the cook, in the which he stood immediately, with his white apron, and his\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"knife by his side. When the king saw him he fell into a passion, and ordered him to be cast into the deepest dungeon. Then the huntsman spoke further and said: 'Father, will you see the maiden who brought me up so tenderly and who was afterwards to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"murder me, but did not do it, though her own life depended on it?' The king replied: 'Yes, I would like to see her.' The son said: 'Most gracious father, I will show her to you in the form of a beautiful flower,' and he thrust his hand into his pocket\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and brought forth the pink, and placed it on the royal table, and it was so beautiful that the king had never seen one to equal it. Then the son said: 'Now will I show her to you in her own form,' and wished that she might become a maiden, and she stood\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"there looking so beautiful that no painter could have made her look more so. And the king sent two waiting-maids and two attendants into the tower, to fetch the queen and bring her to the royal table. But when she was led in she ate nothing, and said:\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"'The gracious and merciful God who has supported me in the tower, will soon set me free.' She lived three days more, and then died happily, and when she was buried, the two white doves which had brought her food to the tower, and were angels of heaven,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"followed her body and seated themselves on her grave. The aged king ordered the cook to be torn in four pieces, but grief consumed the king's own heart, and he soon died. His son married the beautiful maiden whom he had brought with him as a flower in\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"his pocket, and whether they are still alive or not, is known to God.\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

He answered: 'Father, I have learnt what the birds say.' Then the father fell into a rage and said: 'Oh, you lost man, you have spent the precious time and learnt\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"nothing; are you not ashamed to appear before my eyes?

Then the father fell into the most furious anger, sprang up, called his people thither, and said:\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"'This man is no longer my son, I drive him forth, and command you to take him out into the forest, and kill him.' They took him forth, but when they should have killed him, they could not do it for pity, and let him go, and they cut the eyes and tongue\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"out of a deer that they might carry them to the old man as a token. The youth wandered on, and after some time came to a fortress where he begged for a night's lodging. 'Yes,' said the lord of the castle, 'if you will pass the night down there in the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"old tower, go thither; but I warn you, it is at the peril of your life, for it is full of wild dogs, which bark and howl without stopping, and at certain hours a man has to be given to them, whom they at once devour.' The whole district was in sorrow\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and dismay because of them, and yet no one could do anything to stop this. The youth, however, was without fear, and said: 'Just let me go down to the barking dogs, and give me something that I can throw to them; they will do nothing to harm me.' As he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"himself would have it so, they gave him some food for the wild animals, and led him down to the tower. When he went inside, the dogs did not bark at him, but wagged their tails quite amicably around him, ate what he set before them, and did not hurt one\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"hair of his head. Next morning, to the astonishment of everyone, he came out again safe and unharmed, and said to the lord of the castle: 'The dogs have revealed to me, in their own language, why they dwell there, and bring evil on the land.\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"They are bewitched, and are obliged to watch over a great treasure which is below in the tower, and they can have no rest until it is taken away, and I have likewise learnt, from their discourse, how that is to be done.'

The howling of the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"wild dogs was henceforth heard no more; they had disappeared, and the country was freed from the trouble. After some time he took it in his head that he would travel to Rome. On the way he passed by a marsh, in which a number of frogs were sitting\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"croaking.

At last he arrived in Rome, where the Pope had just died, and there was great doubt among the cardinals as to whom they should\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"appoint as his successor. They at length agreed that the person should be chosen as pope who should be distinguished by some divine and miraculous token. And just as that was decided on, the young count entered into the church, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"suddenly two snow-white doves flew on his shoulders and remained sitting there.

'How lonely it is, wife,' said he, as he puffed out a long curl of smoke, 'for you and me to sit here by ourselves, without any\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"children to play about and amuse us while other people seem so happy and merry with their children!' 'What you say is very true,' said the wife, sighing, and turning round her wheel; 'how happy should I be if I had but one child! If it were ever so\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"small--nay, if it were no bigger than my thumb--I should be very happy, and love it dearly.' Now--odd as you may think it--it came to pass that this good woman's wish was fulfilled, just in the very way she had wished it; for, not long afterwards, she\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"had a little boy, who was quite healthy and strong, but was not much bigger than my thumb. So they said, 'Well, we cannot say we have not got what we wished for, and, little as he is, we will love him dearly.' And they called him Thomas Thumb. They gave\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"him plenty of food, yet for all they could do he never grew bigger, but kept just the same size as he had been when he was born. Still, his eyes were sharp and sparkling, and he soon showed himself to be a clever little fellow, who always knew well what\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"he was about. One day, as the woodman was getting ready to go into the wood to cut fuel, he said, 'I wish I had someone to bring the cart after me, for I want to make haste.' 'Oh, father,' cried Tom, 'I will take care of that; the cart shall be in the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"wood by the time you want it.' Then the woodman laughed, and said, 'How can that be? you cannot reach up to the horse's bridle.' 'Never mind that, father,' said Tom; 'if my mother will only harness the horse, I will get into his ear and tell him which\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"way to go.' 'Well,' said the father, 'we will try for once.' When the time came the mother harnessed the horse to the cart, and put Tom into his ear; and as he sat there the little man told the beast how to go, crying out, 'Go on!' and 'Stop!' as he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"wanted: and thus the horse went on just as well as if the woodman had driven it himself into the wood. It happened that as the horse was going a little too fast, and Tom was calling out, 'Gently! gently!' two strangers came up. 'What an odd thing that\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"is!' said one: 'there is a cart going along, and I hear a carter talking to the horse, but yet I can see no one.' 'That is queer, indeed,' said the other; 'let us follow the cart, and see where it goes.' So they went on into the wood, till at last they\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"came to the place where the woodman was. Then Tom Thumb, seeing his father, cried out, 'See, father, here I am with the cart, all right and safe! now take me down!' So his father took hold of the horse with one hand, and with the other took his son out\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"of the horse's ear, and put him down upon a straw, where he sat as merry as you please. The two strangers were all this time looking on, and did not know what to say for wonder. At last one took the other aside, and said, 'That little urchin will make\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"our fortune, if we can get him, and carry him about from town to town as a show; we must buy him.' So they went up to the woodman, and asked him what he would take for the little man. 'He will be better off,' said they, 'with us than with you.' 'I won't\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"sell him at all,' said the father; 'my own flesh and blood is dearer to me than all the silver and gold in the world.' But Tom, hearing of the bargain they wanted to make, crept up his father's coat to his shoulder and whispered in his ear, 'Take the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"money, father, and let them have me; I'll soon come back to you.' So the woodman at last said he would sell Tom to the strangers for a large piece of gold, and they paid the price. 'Where would you like to sit?' said one of them. 'Oh, put me on the rim\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"of your hat; that will be a nice gallery for me; I can walk about there and see the country as we go along.' So they did as he wished; and when Tom had taken leave of his father they took him away with them. They journeyed on till it began to be\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"dusky, and then the little man said, 'Let me get down, I'm tired.' So the man took off his hat, and put him down on a clod of earth, in a ploughed field by the side of the road. But Tom ran about amongst the furrows, and at last slipped into an old\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"mouse-hole. 'Good night, my masters!' said he, 'I'm off! mind and look sharp after me the next time.' Then they ran at once to the place, and poked the ends of their sticks into the mouse-hole, but all in vain; Tom only crawled farther and farther in;\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and at last it became quite dark, so that they were forced to go their way without their prize, as sulky as could be. When Tom found they were gone, he came out of his hiding-place. 'What dangerous walking it is,' said he, 'in this ploughed field! If I\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"were to fall from one of these great clods, I should undoubtedly break my neck.' At last, by good luck, he found a large empty snail-shell. 'This is lucky,' said he, 'I can sleep here very well'; and in he crept. Just as he was falling asleep, he heard\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"two men passing by, chatting together; and one said to the other, 'How can we rob that rich parson's house of his silver and gold?' 'I'll tell you!' cried Tom. 'What noise was that?' said the thief, frightened; 'I'm sure I heard someone speak.' They\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"stood still listening, and Tom said, 'Take me with you, and I'll soon show you how to get the parson's money.' 'But where are you?' said they. 'Look about on the ground,' answered he, 'and listen where the sound comes from.' At last the thieves found\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"him out, and lifted him up in their hands. 'You little urchin!' they said, 'what can you do for us?' 'Why, I can get between the iron window-bars of the parson's house, and throw you out whatever you want.' 'That's a good thought,' said the thieves;\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"'come along, we shall see what you can do.' When they came to the parson's house, Tom slipped through the window-bars into the room, and then called out as loud as he could bawl, 'Will you have all that is here?' At this the thieves were frightened, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"said, 'Softly, softly! Speak low, that you may not awaken anybody.' But Tom seemed as if he did not understand them, and bawled out again, 'How much will you have? Shall I throw it all out?' Now the cook lay in the next room; and hearing a noise\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"she raised herself up in her bed and listened. Meantime the thieves were frightened, and ran off a little way; but at last they plucked up their hearts, and said, 'The little urchin is only trying to make fools of us.' So they came back and whispered\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"softly to him, saying, 'Now let us have no more of your roguish jokes; but throw us out some of the money.' Then Tom called out as loud as he could, 'Very well! hold your hands! here it comes.' The cook heard this quite plain, so she sprang out of bed,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and ran to open the door. The thieves ran off as if a wolf was at their tails: and the maid, having groped about and found nothing, went away for a light. By the time she came back, Tom had slipped off into the barn; and when she had looked about and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"searched every hole and corner, and found nobody, she went to bed, thinking she must have been dreaming with her eyes open. The little man crawled about in the hay-loft, and at last found a snug place to finish his night's rest in; so he laid himself\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"down, meaning to sleep till daylight, and then find his way home to his father and mother. But alas! how woefully he was undone! The cook got up early, before daybreak, to feed the cows; and going straight to the hay-loft, carried away a large\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"bundle of hay, with the little man in the middle of it, fast asleep. He still, however, slept on, and did not awake till he found himself in the mouth of the cow; for the cook had put the hay into the cow's rick, and the cow had taken Tom up in a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"mouthful of it. 'Good lack-a-day!' said he, 'how came I to tumble into the mill?' But he soon found out where he really was; and was forced to have all his wits about him, that he might not get between the cow's teeth, and so be crushed to death. At\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"last down he went into her stomach. 'It is rather dark,' said he; 'they forgot to build windows in this room to let the sun in; a candle would be no bad thing.' Though he made the best of his bad luck, he did not like his quarters at all; and the worst\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"of it was, that more and more hay was always coming down, and the space left for him became smaller and smaller. At last he cried out as loud as he could, 'Don't bring me any more hay! Don't bring me any more hay!' The maid happened to be just then\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"milking the cow; and hearing someone speak, but seeing nobody, and yet being quite sure it was the same voice that she had heard in the night, she was so frightened that she fell off her stool, and overset the milk-pail. As soon as she could pick\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"herself up out of the dirt, she ran off as fast as she could to her master the parson, and said, 'Sir, sir, the cow is talking!' But the parson said, 'Woman, thou art surely mad!' However, he went with her into the cow-house, to try and see what was\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the matter. Scarcely had they set foot on the threshold, when Tom called out, 'Don't bring me any more hay!' Then the parson himself was frightened; and thinking the cow was surely bewitched, told his man to kill her on the spot. So the cow was killed,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and cut up; and the stomach, in which Tom lay, was thrown out upon a dunghill. Tom soon set himself to work to get out, which was not a very easy task; but at last, just as he had made room to get his head out, fresh ill-luck befell him. A hungry wolf\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"sprang out, and swallowed up the whole stomach, with Tom in it, at one gulp, and ran away. Tom, however, was still not disheartened; and thinking the wolf would not dislike having some chat with him as he was going along, he called out, 'My good friend,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"I can show you a famous treat.' 'Where's that?' said the wolf. 'In such and such a house,' said Tom, describing his own father's house. 'You can crawl through the drain into the kitchen and then into the pantry, and there you will find cakes, ham, beef,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"cold chicken, roast pig, apple-dumplings, and everything that your heart can wish.' The wolf did not want to be asked twice; so that very night he went to the house and crawled through the drain into the kitchen, and then into the pantry, and ate and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"drank there to his heart's content. As soon as he had had enough he wanted to get away; but he had eaten so much that he could not go out by the same way he came in. This was just what Tom had reckoned upon; and now he began to set up a great shout,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"making all the noise he could. 'Will you be easy?' said the wolf; 'you'll awaken everybody in the house if you make such a clatter.' 'What's that to me?' said the little man; 'you have had your frolic, now I've a mind to be merry myself'; and he began,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"singing and shouting as loud as he could. The woodman and his wife, being awakened by the noise, peeped through a crack in the door; but when they saw a wolf was there, you may well suppose that they were sadly frightened; and the woodman ran for\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"his axe, and gave his wife a scythe. 'Do you stay behind,' said the woodman, 'and when I have knocked him on the head you must rip him up with the scythe.' Tom heard all this, and cried out, 'Father, father! I am here, the wolf has swallowed me.' And\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"his father said, 'Heaven be praised! we have found our dear child again'; and he told his wife not to use the scythe for fear she should hurt him. Then he aimed a great blow, and struck the wolf on the head, and killed him on the spot! and when he was\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"dead they cut open his body, and set Tommy free. 'Ah!' said the father, 'what fears we have had for you!' 'Yes, father,' answered he; 'I have travelled all over the world, I think, in one way or other, since we parted; and now I am very glad to come\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"home and get fresh air again.' 'Why, where have you been?' said his father. 'I have been in a mouse-hole--and in a snail-shell--and down a cow's throat--and in the wolf's belly; and yet here I am again, safe and sound.' 'Well,' said they, 'you are\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"come back, and we will not sell you again for all the riches in the world.' Then they hugged and kissed their dear little son, and gave him plenty to eat and drink; and then they fetched new clothes for him, for his old ones had been quite spoiled on\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"his journey. So Master Thumb stayed at home with his father and mother, in peace; for though he had been so great a traveller, and was fond enough of telling the whole story, he always agreed that, after all, there's no place like HOME!\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

His master therefore was tired of keeping him and began to think of putting an end to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"him; but the ass, who saw that some mischief was in the wind, took himself slyly off, and began his journey towards the great city, 'For there,' thought he, 'I may turn musician.' After he had travelled a little way, he spied a dog lying by the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"roadside and panting as if he were tired. 'What makes you pant so, my friend?' said the ass. 'Alas!' said the dog, 'my master was going to knock me on the head, because I am old and weak, and can no longer make myself useful to him in hunting; so I ran\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"away; but what can I do to earn my livelihood?' 'Hark ye!' said the ass, 'I am going to the great city to turn musician: suppose you go with me, and try what you can do in the same way?' The dog said he was willing, and they jogged on together. They had\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"not gone far before they saw a cat sitting in the middle of the road and making a most rueful face. 'Pray, my good lady,' said the ass, 'what's the matter with you? You look quite out of spirits!' 'Ah, me!' said the cat, 'how can one be in good spirits\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"when one's life is in danger?

'Oh,' said the ass, 'by all means go with us to the great city; you are a good night singer, and may make your fortune as a musician.' The cat was pleased with the thought, and joined the party. Soon\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"afterwards, as they were passing by a farmyard, they saw a cock perched upon a gate, and screaming out with all his might and main. 'Bravo!' said the ass; 'upon my word, you make a famous noise; pray what is all this about?' 'Why,' said the cock, 'I was\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"just now saying that we should have fine weather for our washing-day, and yet my mistress and the cook don't thank me for my pains, but threaten to cut off my head tomorrow, and make broth of me for the guests that are coming on Sunday!' 'Heaven\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"forbid!' said the ass, 'come with us Master Chanticleer; it will be better, at any rate, than staying here to have your head cut off! Besides, who knows? If we care to sing in tune, we may get up some kind of a concert; so come along with us.' 'With all\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"my heart,' said the cock: so they all four went on jollily together. They could not, however, reach the great city the first day; so when night came on, they went into a wood to sleep. The ass and the dog laid themselves down under a great\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"tree, and the cat climbed up into the branches; while the cock, thinking that the higher he sat the safer he should be, flew up to the very top of the tree, and then, according to his custom, before he went to sleep, looked out on all sides of him to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"see that everything was well. In doing this, he saw afar off something bright and shining and calling to his companions said, 'There must be a house no great way off, for I see a light.' 'If that be the case,' said the ass, 'we had better change our\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"quarters, for our lodging is not the best in the world!' 'Besides,' added the dog, 'I should not be the worse for a bone or two, or a bit of meat.' So they walked off together towards the spot where Chanticleer had seen the light, and as they drew near\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"it became larger and brighter, till they at last came close to a house in which a gang of robbers lived. The ass, being the tallest of the company, marched up to the window and peeped in. 'Well, Donkey,' said Chanticleer, 'what do you see?' 'What do I\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"see?' replied the ass. 'Why, I see a table spread with all kinds of good things, and robbers sitting round it making merry.' 'That would be a noble lodging for us,' said the cock. 'Yes,' said the ass, 'if we could only get in'; so they consulted\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"together how they should contrive to get the robbers out; and at last they hit upon a plan. The ass placed himself upright on his hind legs, with his forefeet resting against the window; the dog got upon his back; the cat scrambled up to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the dog's shoulders, and the cock flew up and sat upon the cat's head. When all was ready a signal was given, and they began their music. The ass brayed, the dog barked, the cat mewed, and the cock screamed; and then they all broke through the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"window at once, and came tumbling into the room, amongst the broken glass, with a most hideous clatter! The robbers, who had been not a little frightened by the opening concert, had now no doubt that some frightful hobgoblin had broken in upon them,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and scampered away as fast as they could. The coast once clear, our travellers soon sat down and dispatched what the robbers had left, with as much eagerness as if they had not expected to eat again for a month. As soon as they had satisfied themselves,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"they put out the lights, and each once more sought out a resting-place to his own liking. The donkey laid himself down upon a heap of straw in the yard, the dog stretched himself upon a mat behind the door, the cat rolled herself up on the hearth before\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the warm ashes, and the cock perched upon a beam on the top of the house; and, as they were all rather tired with their journey, they soon fell asleep. But about midnight, when the robbers saw from afar that the lights were out and that all seemed\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"quiet, they began to think that they had been in too great a hurry to run away; and one of them, who was bolder than the rest, went to see what was going on. Finding everything still, he marched into the kitchen, and groped about till he found a match\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"in order to light a candle; and then, espying the glittering fiery eyes of the cat, he mistook them for live coals, and held the match to them to light it. But the cat, not understanding this joke, sprang at his face, and spat, and scratched at him.\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"This frightened him dreadfully, and away he ran to the back door; but there the dog jumped up and bit him in the leg; and as he was crossing over the yard the ass kicked him; and the cock, who had been awakened by the noise, crowed with all his might.\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"At this the robber ran back as fast as he could to his comrades, and told the captain how a horrid witch had got into the house, and had spat at him and scratched his face with her long bony fingers; how a man with a knife in his hand had hidden himself\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"behind the door, and stabbed him in the leg; how a black monster stood in the yard and struck him with a club, and how the devil had sat upon the top of the house and cried out, 'Throw the rascal up here!'

At last it was so big that it filled a cart, and two oxen could hardly draw it; and the gardener knew not what in the world to do with it, nor whether it would be a blessing or a curse to him. One day he said to himself, 'What shall I do\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"with it? if I sell it, it will bring no more than another; and for eating, the little turnips are better than this; the best thing perhaps is to carry it and give it to the king as a mark of respect.'

The king took the gift very graciously, and said he knew not what to give in return more valuable and wonderful than the great turnip; so\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the soldier was forced to put it into a cart, and drag it home with him. When he reached home, he knew not upon whom to vent his rage and spite; and at length wicked thoughts came into his head, and he resolved to kill his brother. So he hired some\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"villains to murder him; and having shown them where to lie in ambush, he went to his brother, and said, 'Dear brother, I have found a hidden treasure; let us go and dig it up, and share it between us.'

Meantime he worked and worked away, till he made a hole large enough to put out his head.\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"When the horseman came up, he proved to be a student, a merry fellow, who was journeying along on his nag, and singing as he went.

The student looked about everywhere; and seeing no one, and not knowing where the voice came from, cried out, 'Who calls me?' Then the man in the tree answered, 'Lift up thine eyes, for behold here I sit in the sack of wisdom; here have I,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"in a short time, learned great and wondrous things. Compared to this seat, all the learning of the schools is as empty air. A little longer, and I shall know all that man can know, and shall come forth wiser than the wisest of mankind.

The student listened to all this and wondered much; at last he said, 'Blessed be the day and hour when I found you; cannot you contrive to let me into the sack for a little while?' Then the other\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"answered, as if very unwillingly, 'A little space I may allow thee to sit here, if thou wilt reward me well and entreat me kindly; but thou must tarry yet an hour below, till I have learnt some little matters that are yet unknown to me.' So the student\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"sat himself down and waited a while; but the time hung heavy upon him, and he begged earnestly that he might ascend forthwith, for his thirst for knowledge was great. Then the other pretended to give way, and said, 'Thou must let the sack of wisdom\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"descend, by untying yonder cord, and then thou shalt enter.' So the student let him down, opened the sack, and set him free. 'Now then,' cried he, 'let me ascend quickly.'

And when he was sitting beside her and very happy, news came that his father lay sick unto death, and desired to see him once again before his end. Then he said to his beloved: 'I\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"must now go and leave you, I give you a ring as a remembrance of me. When I am king, I will return and fetch you.' So he rode away, and when he reached his father, the latter was dangerously ill, and near his death. He said to him: 'Dear son, I wished\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"to see you once again before my end, promise me to marry as I wish,' and he named a certain king's daughter who was to be his wife. The son was in such trouble that he did not think what he was doing, and said: 'Yes, dear father, your will shall be\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"done,' and thereupon the king shut his eyes, and died. When therefore the son had been proclaimed king, and the time of mourning was over, he was forced to keep the promise which he had given his father, and caused the king's daughter to be asked in\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"marriage, and she was promised to him. His first betrothed heard of this, and fretted so much about his faithfulness that she nearly died. Then her father said to her: 'Dearest child, why are you so sad? You shall have whatsoever you\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"will.' She thought for a moment and said: 'Dear father, I wish for eleven girls exactly like myself in face, figure, and size.' The father said: 'If it be possible, your desire shall be fulfilled,' and he caused a search to be made in his whole\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"kingdom, until eleven young maidens were found who exactly resembled his daughter in face, figure, and size. When they came to the king's daughter, she had twelve suits of huntsmen's clothes made, all alike, and the eleven maidens had to put on the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"huntsmen's clothes, and she herself put on the twelfth suit. Thereupon she took her leave of her father, and rode away with them, and rode to the court of her former betrothed, whom she loved so dearly. Then she asked if he required any\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"huntsmen, and if he would take all of them into his service. The king looked at her and did not know her, but as they were such handsome fellows, he said: 'Yes,' and that he would willingly take them, and now they were the king's twelve huntsmen. The\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"king, however, had a lion which was a wondrous animal, for he knew all concealed and secret things. It came to pass that one evening he said to the king: 'You think you have twelve huntsmen?' 'Yes,' said the king, 'they are twelve huntsmen.' The lion\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"continued: 'You are mistaken, they are twelve girls.' The king said: 'That cannot be true! How will you prove that to me?' 'Oh, just let some peas be strewn in the ante-chamber,' answered the lion, 'and then you will soon see. Men have a firm step, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"when they walk over peas none of them stir, but girls trip and skip, and drag their feet, and the peas roll about.' The king was well pleased with the counsel, and caused the peas to be strewn. There was, however, a servant of the king's who favoured\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the huntsmen, and when he heard that they were going to be put to this test he went to them and repeated everything, and said: 'The lion wants to make the king believe that you are girls.' Then the king's daughter thanked him, and said to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"her maidens: 'Show some strength, and step firmly on the peas.' So next morning when the king had the twelve huntsmen called before him, and they came into the ante-chamber where the peas were lying, they stepped so firmly on them, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"had such a strong, sure walk, that not one of the peas either rolled or stirred. Then they went away again, and the king said to the lion: 'You have lied to me, they walk just like men.' The lion said: 'They have been informed that they were going to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"be put to the test, and have assumed some strength. Just let twelve spinning-wheels be brought into the ante-chamber, and they will go to them and be pleased with them, and that is what no man would do.' The king liked the advice, and had the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"spinning-wheels placed in the ante-chamber. But the servant, who was well disposed to the huntsmen, went to them, and disclosed the project. So when they were alone the king's daughter said to her eleven girls: 'Show some constraint, and do\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"not look round at the spinning-wheels.' And next morning when the king had his twelve huntsmen summoned, they went through the ante-chamber, and never once looked at the spinning-wheels. Then the king again said to the lion: 'You have deceived\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"me, they are men, for they have not looked at the spinning-wheels.' The lion replied: 'They have restrained themselves.' The king, however, would no longer believe the lion. The twelve huntsmen always followed the king to the chase, and his\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"liking for them continually increased. Now it came to pass that once when they were out hunting, news came that the king's bride was approaching. When the true bride heard that, it hurt her so much that her heart was almost\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"broken, and she fell fainting to the ground. The king thought something had happened to his dear huntsman, ran up to him, wanted to help him, and drew his glove off. Then he saw the ring which he had given to his first bride, and when he looked in her\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"face he recognized her. Then his heart was so touched that he kissed her, and when she opened her eyes he said: 'You are mine, and I am yours, and no one in the world can alter that.' He sent a messenger to the other bride, and entreated her to return\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"to her own kingdom, for he had a wife already, and someone who had just found an old key did not require a new one. Thereupon the wedding was celebrated, and the lion was again taken into favour, because, after all, he had told the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"truth.\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

Nothing was hidden from him, and it seemed as if news of the most secret things was brought to him through the air. But he had a strange custom; every day after\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"dinner, when the table was cleared, and no one else was present, a trusty servant had to bring him one more dish. It was covered, however, and even the servant did not know what was in it, neither did anyone know, for the king never took off the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"cover to eat of it until he was quite alone. This had gone on for a long time, when one day the servant, who took away the dish, was overcome with such curiosity that he could not help carrying the dish into his room. When he had carefully locked\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the door, he lifted up the cover, and saw a white snake lying on the dish. But when he saw it he could not deny himself the pleasure of tasting it, so he cut of a little bit and put it into his mouth. No sooner had it touched his tongue than he heard a\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"strange whispering of little voices outside his window. He went and listened, and then noticed that it was the sparrows who were chattering together, and telling one another of all kinds of things which they had seen in the fields and woods. Eating the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"snake had given him power of understanding the language of animals. Now it so happened that on this very day the queen lost her most beautiful ring, and suspicion of having stolen it fell upon this trusty servant, who was allowed to go\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"everywhere. The king ordered the man to be brought before him, and threatened with angry words that unless he could before the morrow point out the thief, he himself should be looked upon as guilty and executed. In vain he declared his innocence; he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"was dismissed with no better answer. In his trouble and fear he went down into the courtyard and took thought how to help himself out of his trouble. Now some ducks were sitting together quietly by a brook and taking their rest; and, whilst they were\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"making their feathers smooth with their bills, they were having a confidential conversation together. The servant stood by and listened. They were telling one another of all the places where they had been waddling about all the morning, and what\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"good food they had found; and one said in a pitiful tone: 'Something lies heavy on my stomach; as I was eating in haste I swallowed a ring which lay under the queen's window.' The servant at once seized her by the neck, carried her to the kitchen, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"said to the cook: 'Here is a fine duck; pray, kill her.' 'Yes,' said the cook, and weighed her in his hand; 'she has spared no trouble to fatten herself, and has been waiting to be roasted long enough.' So he cut off her head, and as she was being\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"dressed for the spit, the queen's ring was found inside her. The servant could now easily prove his innocence; and the king, to make amends for the wrong, allowed him to ask a favour, and promised him the best place in the court that he could wish for.\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"The servant refused everything, and only asked for a horse and some money for travelling, as he had a mind to see the world and go about a little. When his request was granted he set out on his way, and one day came to a pond, where he saw three fishes\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"caught in the reeds and gasping for water. Now, though it is said that fishes are dumb, he heard them lamenting that they must perish so miserably, and, as he had a kind heart, he got off his horse and put the three prisoners back into the water. They\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"leapt with delight, put out their heads, and cried to him: 'We will remember you and repay you for saving us!' He rode on, and after a while it seemed to him that he heard a voice in the sand at his feet. He listened, and heard an ant-king complain:\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"'Why cannot folks, with their clumsy beasts, keep off our bodies? That stupid horse, with his heavy hoofs, has been treading down my people without mercy!' So he turned on to a side path and the ant-king cried out to him: 'We will remember you--one good\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"turn deserves another!' The path led him into a wood, and there he saw two old ravens standing by their nest, and throwing out their young ones. 'Out with you, you idle, good-for-nothing creatures!' cried they; 'we cannot find food for you any\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"longer; you are big enough, and can provide for yourselves.' But the poor young ravens lay upon the ground, flapping their wings, and crying: 'Oh, what helpless chicks we are! We must shift for ourselves, and yet we cannot fly! What can we do, but lie\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"here and starve?' So the good young fellow alighted and killed his horse with his sword, and gave it to them for food. Then they came hopping up to it, satisfied their hunger, and cried: 'We will remember you--one good turn deserves another!' And now he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"had to use his own legs, and when he had walked a long way, he came to a large city. There was a great noise and crowd in the streets, and a man rode up on horseback, crying aloud: 'The king's daughter wants a husband; but whoever seeks\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"her hand must perform a hard task, and if he does not succeed he will forfeit his life.' Many had already made the attempt, but in vain; nevertheless when the youth saw the king's daughter he was so overcome by her great beauty that he forgot all\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"danger, went before the king, and declared himself a suitor. So he was led out to the sea, and a gold ring was thrown into it, before his eyes; then the king ordered him to fetch this ring up from the bottom of the sea, and added: 'If you come up again\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"without it you will be thrown in again and again until you perish amid the waves.' All the people grieved for the handsome youth; then they went away, leaving him alone by the sea. He stood on the shore and considered what he should do, when suddenly he\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"saw three fishes come swimming towards him, and they were the very fishes whose lives he had saved. The one in the middle held a mussel in its mouth, which it laid on the shore at the youth's feet, and when he had taken it up and opened it, there lay\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the gold ring in the shell. Full of joy he took it to the king and expected that he would grant him the promised reward. But when the proud princess perceived that he was not her equal in birth, she scorned him, and required him first to perform another\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"task. She went down into the garden and strewed with her own hands ten sacksful of millet-seed on the grass; then she said: 'Tomorrow morning before sunrise these must be picked up, and not a single grain be wanting.' The youth sat down in the garden\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and considered how it might be possible to perform this task, but he could think of nothing, and there he sat sorrowfully awaiting the break of day, when he should be led to death. But as soon as the first rays of the sun shone into the garden he saw\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"all the ten sacks standing side by side, quite full, and not a single grain was missing. The ant-king had come in the night with thousands and thousands of ants, and the grateful creatures had by great industry picked up all the millet-seed and gathered\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"them into the sacks. Presently the king's daughter herself came down into the garden, and was amazed to see that the young man had done the task she had given him. But she could not yet conquer her proud heart, and said: 'Although he has\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"performed both the tasks, he shall not be my husband until he had brought me an apple from the Tree of Life.' The youth did not know where the Tree of Life stood, but he set out, and would have gone on for ever, as long as his legs would carry him,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"though he had no hope of finding it. After he had wandered through three kingdoms, he came one evening to a wood, and lay down under a tree to sleep. But he heard a rustling in the branches, and a golden apple fell into his hand. At the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"same time three ravens flew down to him, perched themselves upon his knee, and said: 'We are the three young ravens whom you saved from starving; when we had grown big, and heard that you were seeking the Golden Apple, we flew over the sea to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the end of the world, where the Tree of Life stands, and have brought you the apple.' The youth, full of joy, set out homewards, and took the Golden Apple to the king's beautiful daughter, who had now no more excuses left to make. They cut the Apple of\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Life in two and ate it together; and then her heart became full of love for him, and they lived in undisturbed happiness to a great age.\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

When the young wrens\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"heard that, they were frightfully angry, and screamed: 'No, that we are not! Our parents are honest people! Bear, you will have to pay for that!' The bear and the wolf grew uneasy, and turned back and went into their holes. The young willow-wrens,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"however, continued to cry and scream, and when their parents again brought food they said: 'We will not so much as touch one fly's leg, no, not if we were dying of hunger, until you have settled whether we are respectable children or not; the bear has\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"been here and has insulted us!' Then the old King said: 'Be easy, he shall be punished,' and he at once flew with the Queen to the bear's cave, and called in: 'Old Growler, why have you insulted my children? You shall suffer for it--we will punish you\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"by a bloody war.' Thus war was announced to the Bear, and all four-footed animals were summoned to take part in it, oxen, asses, cows, deer, and every other animal the earth contained. And the willow-wren summoned everything which flew in the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"air, not only birds, large and small, but midges, and hornets, bees and flies had to come. When the time came for the war to begin, the willow-wren sent out spies to discover who was the enemy's commander-in-chief. The gnat, who was the most crafty,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"flew into the forest where the enemy was assembled, and hid herself beneath a leaf of the tree where the password was to be announced. There stood the bear, and he called the fox before him and said: 'Fox, you are the most cunning of\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"all animals, you shall be general and lead us.' 'Good,' said the fox, 'but what signal shall we agree upon?' No one knew that, so the fox said: 'I have a fine long bushy tail, which almost looks like a plume of red feathers. When I lift my tail up\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"quite high, all is going well, and you must charge; but if I let it hang down, run away as fast as you can.' When the gnat had heard that, she flew away again, and revealed everything, down to the minutest detail, to the willow-wren. When day broke, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the battle was to begin, all the four-footed animals came running up with such a noise that the earth trembled. The willow-wren with his army also came flying through the air with such a humming, and whirring, and swarming that every one was uneasy\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and afraid, and on both sides they advanced against each other. But the willow-wren sent down the hornet, with orders to settle beneath the fox's tail, and sting with all his might. When the fox felt the first string, he started so that he lifted one\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"leg, from pain, but he bore it, and still kept his tail high in the air; at the second sting, he was forced to put it down for a moment; at the third, he could hold out no longer, screamed, and put his tail between his legs. When the animals saw that,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"they thought all was lost, and began to flee, each into his hole, and the birds had won the battle. Then the King and Queen flew home to their children and cried: 'Children, rejoice, eat and drink to your heart's content, we have won the battle!' But\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the young wrens said: 'We will not eat yet, the bear must come to the nest, and beg for pardon and say that we are honourable children, before we will do that.' Then the willow-wren flew to the bear's hole and cried: 'Growler, you are to come to the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"nest to my children, and beg their pardon, or else every rib of your body shall be broken.' So the bear crept thither in the greatest fear, and begged their pardon. And now at last the young wrens were satisfied, and sat down together\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"and ate and drank, and made merry till quite late into the night.\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"

One day she wanted to go into the forest and fetch some food. So she called all seven to her and said: 'Dear children, I\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"have to go into the forest, be on your guard against the wolf; if he comes in, he will devour you all--skin, hair, and everything. The wretch often disguises himself, but you will know him at once by his rough voice and his black feet.' The kids\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"said: 'Dear mother, we will take good care of ourselves; you may go away without any anxiety.' Then the old one bleated, and went on her way with an easy mind. It was not long before someone knocked at the house-door and called: 'Open the door, dear\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"children; your mother is here, and has brought something back with her for each of you.' But the little kids knew that it was the wolf, by the rough voice. 'We will not open the door,' cried they, 'you are not our mother. She has a soft, pleasant voice,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"but your voice is rough; you are the wolf!' Then the wolf went away to a shopkeeper and bought himself a great lump of chalk, ate this and made his voice soft with it. Then he came back, knocked at the door of the house, and called: 'Open the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"door, dear children, your mother is here and has brought something back with her for each of you.' But the wolf had laid his black paws against the window, and the children saw them and cried: 'We will not open the door, our mother has not black feet\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"like you: you are the wolf!' Then the wolf ran to a baker and said: 'I have hurt my feet, rub some dough over them for me.' And when the baker had rubbed his feet over, he ran to the miller and said: 'Strew some white meal over my feet for me.' The\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"miller thought to himself: 'The wolf wants to deceive someone,' and refused; but the wolf said: 'If you will not do it, I will devour you.' Then the miller was afraid, and made his paws white for him. Truly, this is the way of mankind. So now the wretch\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"went for the third time to the house-door, knocked at it and said: 'Open the door for me, children, your dear little mother has come home, and has brought every one of you something back from the forest with her.' The little kids cried: 'First show us\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"your paws that we may know if you are our dear little mother.' Then he put his paws in through the window and when the kids saw that they were white, they believed that all he said was true, and opened the door. But who should come in but the wolf! They\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"were terrified and wanted to hide themselves. One sprang under the table, the second into the bed, the third into the stove, the fourth into the kitchen, the fifth into the cupboard, the sixth under the washing-bowl, and the seventh into the\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"clock-case. But the wolf found them all, and used no great ceremony; one after the other he swallowed them down his throat. The youngest, who was in the clock-case, was the only one he did not find. When the wolf had satisfied his appetite he took\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"himself off, laid himself down under a tree in the green meadow outside, and began to sleep. Soon afterwards the old goat came home again from the forest. Ah! what a sight she saw there! The house-door stood wide open. The table, chairs, and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"benches were thrown down, the washing-bowl lay broken to pieces, and the quilts and pillows were pulled off the bed. She sought her children, but they were nowhere to be found. She called them one after another by name, but no one answered.\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"At last, when she came to the youngest, a soft voice cried: 'Dear mother, I am in the clock-case.' She took the kid out, and it told her that the wolf had come and had eaten all the others. Then you may imagine how she wept over her poor children. At\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"length in her grief she went out, and the youngest kid ran with her. When they came to the meadow, there lay the wolf by the tree and snored so loud that the branches shook. She looked at him on every side and saw that something was moving and\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"struggling in his gorged belly. 'Ah, heavens,' she said, 'is it possible that my poor children whom he has swallowed down for his supper, can be still alive?' Then the kid had to run home and fetch scissors, and a needle and thread, and the goat cut\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"open the monster's stomach, and hardly had she made one cut, than one little kid thrust its head out, and when she had cut farther, all six sprang out one after another, and were all still alive, and had suffered no injury whatever, for in his\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"greediness the monster had swallowed them down whole. What rejoicing there was! They embraced their dear mother, and jumped like a tailor at his wedding. The mother, however, said: 'Now go and look for some big stones, and we will fill the wicked\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"beast's stomach with them while he is still asleep.' Then the seven kids dragged the stones thither with all speed, and put as many of them into this stomach as they could get in; and the mother sewed him up again in the greatest haste, so that he was\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"not aware of anything and never once stirred. When the wolf at length had had his fill of sleep, he got on his legs, and as the stones in his stomach made him very thirsty, he wanted to go to a well to drink. But when he began to walk and to move about,\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"the stones in his stomach knocked against each other and rattled. Then cried he: 'What rumbles and tumbles Against my poor bones? I thought 'twas six kids, But it feels like big stones.' And when he got to the well and stooped over the water to\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"drink, the heavy stones made him fall in, and he drowned miserably. When the seven kids saw that, they came running to the spot and cried aloud: 'The wolf is dead! The wolf is dead!' and danced for joy round about the well with their mother.\\\"}\"], \"generation\": 3}"
