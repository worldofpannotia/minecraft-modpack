### Lore Geek By Wiccy###

This is a simple data pack is for adding lore to any item with formatting.

### Usage ###

First you will need a "Book and Quill" as this is where you will format the lore to be added to an item.
Once you have set you lore text in the "Book and Quill" drop the item you want to attach the lore to on the ground within five( 5 ) blocks of yourself.
Make sure there are no other items nearby then have the "Book and Quill" selected in your hotbar and type "/trigger AddLore" into chat without the quotes( " " ) and hit enter.

And that is it pick up the item and hover over the item to see the lore.

**If you see no/partial lore that would mean there is an error the formatting in the book.**

### Formatting ###

### Important ###
Make sure all formatting is within square brackets( [ ] ) on every page used.

{"text":"%%%"} = The text itself, replace %%% with the text you want for lore.

Below is the extra formatting and must be places before the closing curly bracket ( } ).

All these are optional and can be in any order.

,"bold":true            = Makes text bold, Default is false
,"italic":false         = Makes text italic, Default is true
,"strikethrough":true   = Add a line through the text, Default is false
,"underlined":true      = Add a line under the text, Default is false
,"obfuscated":true      = Make text unreadable and forever shifting, Default is false
,"color":"%%%"          = Changes the colour of the text, Default is "dark_purple". Replace %%% with a colour name Minecraft recognises or use a hex value.
